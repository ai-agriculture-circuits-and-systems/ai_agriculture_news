| **[AgMMU: A Comprehensive Agricultural Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10568v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We curate a dataset AgMMU for evaluating and developing vision-language models (VLMs) to produce factually accurate answers for knowledge-intensive expert domains. Our AgMMU concentrates on one of the most socially beneficial domains, agriculture, which requires connecting detailed visual observation with precise knowledge to diagnose, e.g., pest identification, management instructions, etc. As a core uniqueness of our dataset, all facts, questions, and answers are extracted from 116,231 conversations between real-world users and authorized agricultural experts. After a three-step dataset curation pipeline with GPT-4o, LLaMA models, and human verification, AgMMU features an evaluation set of 5,460 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs). We also provide a development set that contains 205,399 pieces of agricultural knowledge information, including disease identification, symptoms descriptions, management instructions, insect and pest identification, and species identification. As a multimodal factual dataset, it reveals that existing VLMs face significant challenges with questions requiring both detailed perception and factual knowledge. Moreover, open-source VLMs still demonstrate a substantial performance gap compared to proprietary ones. To advance knowledge-intensive VLMs, we conduct fine-tuning experiments using our development set, which improves LLaVA-1.5 evaluation accuracy by up to 3.1%. We hope that AgMMU can serve both as an evaluation benchmark dedicated to agriculture and a development suite for incorporating knowledge-intensive expertise into general-purpose VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://agmmu.github.io/ Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AgMMU/AgMMU_v1/</p></details> |
| **[agriFrame: Agricultural framework to remotely control a rover inside a greenhouse environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09079v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for innovation in agriculture is essential for food security worldwide and more implicit in developing countries. With growing demand comes a reduction in rapid development time. Data collection and analysis are essential in agriculture. However, considering a given crop, its cycle comes once a year, and researchers must wait a few months before collecting more data for the given crop. To overcome this hurdle, researchers are venturing into digital twins for agriculture. Toward this effort, we present an agricultural framework(agriFrame). Here, we introduce a simulated greenhouse environment for testing and controlling a robot and remotely controlling/implementing the algorithms in the real-world greenhouse setup. This work showcases the importance/interdependence of network setup, remotely controllable rover, and messaging protocol. The sophisticated yet simple-to-use agriFrame has been optimized for the simulator on minimal laptop/desktop specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Adaptation of Grounding DINO for Agricultural Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07252v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are transforming agricultural applications by enabling automated phenotyping, monitoring, and yield estimation. However, their effectiveness heavily depends on large amounts of annotated training data, which can be labor and time intensive. Recent advances in open-set object detection, particularly with models like Grounding-DINO, offer a potential solution to detect regions of interests based on text prompt input. Initial zero-shot experiments revealed challenges in crafting effective text prompts, especially for complex objects like individual leaves and visually similar classes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient few-shot adaptation method that simplifies the Grounding-DINO architecture by removing the text encoder module (BERT) and introducing a randomly initialized trainable text embedding. This method achieves superior performance across multiple agricultural datasets, including plant-weed detection, plant counting, insect identification, fruit counting, and remote sensing tasks. Specifically, it demonstrates up to a $\sim24\%$ higher mAP than fully fine-tuned YOLO models on agricultural datasets and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by $\sim10\%$ in remote sensing, under few-shot learning conditions. Our method offers a promising solution for automating annotation and accelerating the development of specialized agricultural AI solutions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multimodal Agricultural Agent Architecture (MA3): A New Paradigm for Intelligent Agricultural Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04789v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a strategic pillar industry for human survival and development, modern agriculture faces dual challenges: optimizing production efficiency and achieving sustainable development. Against the backdrop of intensified climate change leading to frequent extreme weather events, the uncertainty risks in agricultural production systems are increasing exponentially. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}gricultural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{A}rchitecture (\textbf{MA3}), which leverages cross-modal information fusion and task collaboration mechanisms to achieve intelligent agricultural decision-making. This study constructs a multimodal agricultural agent dataset encompassing five major tasks: classification, detection, Visual Question Answering (VQA), tool selection, and agent evaluation. We propose a unified backbone for sugarcane disease classification and detection tools, as well as a sugarcane disease expert model. By integrating an innovative tool selection module, we develop a multimodal agricultural agent capable of effectively performing tasks in classification, detection, and VQA. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the entire architecture over our evaluation dataset, thereby verifying the practicality and robustness of MA3 in agricultural scenarios. This study provides new insights and methodologies for the development of agricultural agents, holding significant theoretical and practical implications. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy Efficient Planning for Repetitive Heterogeneous Tasks in Precision Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03938v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic weed removal in precision agriculture introduces a repetitive heterogeneous task planning (RHTP) challenge for a mobile manipulator. RHTP has two unique characteristics: 1) an observe-first-and-manipulate-later (OFML) temporal constraint that forces a unique ordering of two different tasks for each target and 2) energy savings from efficient task collocation to minimize unnecessary movements. RHTP can be framed as a stochastic renewal process. According to the Renewal Reward Theorem, the expected energy usage per task cycle is the long-run average. Traditional task and motion planning focuses on feasibility rather than optimality due to the unknown object and obstacle position prior to execution. However, the known target/obstacle distribution in precision agriculture allows minimizing the expected energy usage. For each instance in this renewal process, we first compute task space partition, a novel data structure that computes all possibilities of task multiplexing and its probabilities with robot reachability. Then we propose a region-based set-coverage problem to formulate the RHTP as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming. We have implemented and solved RHTP using Branch-and-Bound solver. Compared to a baseline in simulations based on real field data, the results suggest a significant improvement in path length, number of robot stops, overall energy usage, and number of replans.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[FADConv: A Frequency-Aware Dynamic Convolution for Farmland Non-agriculturalization Identification and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03510v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cropland non-agriculturalization refers to the conversion of arable land into non-agricultural uses such as forests, residential areas, and construction sites. This phenomenon not only directly leads to the loss of cropland resources but also poses systemic threats to food security and agricultural sustainability. Accurate identification of cropland and non-cropland areas is crucial for detecting and addressing this issue. Traditional CNNs employ static convolution layers, while dynamic convolution studies demonstrate that adaptively weighting multiple convolutional kernels through attention mechanisms can enhance accuracy. However, existing dynamic convolution methods relying on Global Average Pooling (GAP) for attention weight allocation suffer from information loss, limiting segmentation precision. This paper proposes Frequency-Aware Dynamic Convolution (FADConv) and a Frequency Attention (FAT) module to address these limitations. Building upon the foundational structure of dynamic convolution, we designed FADConv by integrating 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (2D DCT) to capture frequency domain features and fuse them. FAT module generates high-quality attention weights that replace the traditional GAP method,making the combination between dynamic convolution kernels more reasonable.Experiments on the GID and Hi-CNA datasets demonstrate that FADConv significantly improves segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. For instance, ResNet18 with FADConv achieves 1.9% and 2.7% increases in F1-score and IoU for cropland segmentation on GID, with only 58.87M additional MAdds. Compared to other dynamic convolution approaches, FADConv exhibits superior performance in cropland segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive path planning for efficient object search by UAVs in agricultural fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02473v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of localization errors and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8 detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the field, when the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects, resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed to find non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy. The path planner is made available at https://github.com/wur-abe/uav_adaptive_planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinsuring AI: Energy, Agriculture, Finance & Medicine as Precedents for Scalable Governance of Frontier Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02127v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The governance of frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems--particularly those capable of catastrophic misuse or systemic failure--requires institutional structures that are robust, adaptive, and innovation-preserving. This paper proposes a novel framework for governing such high-stakes models through a three-tiered insurance architecture: (1) mandatory private liability insurance for frontier model developers; (2) an industry-administered risk pool to absorb recurring, non-catastrophic losses; and (3) federally backed reinsurance for tail-risk events. Drawing from historical precedents in nuclear energy (Price-Anderson), terrorism risk (TRIA), agricultural crop insurance, flood reinsurance, and medical malpractice, the proposal shows how the federal government can stabilize private AI insurance markets without resorting to brittle regulation or predictive licensing regimes. The structure aligns incentives between AI developers and downstream stakeholders, transforms safety practices into insurable standards, and enables modular oversight through adaptive eligibility criteria. By focusing on risk-transfer mechanisms rather than prescriptive rules, this framework seeks to render AI safety a structural feature of the innovation ecosystem itself--integrated into capital markets, not external to them. The paper concludes with a legal and administrative feasibility analysis, proposing avenues for statutory authorization and agency placement within existing federal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Worki...</summary><p>Working paper version (35 pages).

| **[Predicting and Mitigating Agricultural Price Volatility Using Climate Scenarios and Risk Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24324v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural price volatility challenges sustainable finance, planning, and policy, driven by market dynamics and meteorological factors such as temperature and precipitation. In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system acts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without premium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for soybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze historical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate case) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions strongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data into volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate conditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather and price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put option, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium, quantifying its fiscal cost. We propose this novel market-based risk-hedging mechanism wherein the government purchases insurance equivalent to MSP, leveraging Black-Scholes for accurate premium estimation. Our results underscore the importance of meteorological data in agricultural risk modeling, supporting targeted insurance and strengthening resilience in agricultural finance. This climate-informed financial framework enhances risk-sharing, stabilizes prices, and informs sustainable agricultural policy under growing climate uncertainty.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Internet of Things-Based Smart Precision Farming in Soilless Agriculture: Opportunities and Challenges for Global Food Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13528v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgRowStitch: A High-fidelity Image Stitching Pipeline for Ground-based Agricultural Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21990v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural imaging often requires individual images to be stitched together into a final mosaic for analysis. However, agricultural images can be particularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is difficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built from many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues can be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high altitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To address this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching ground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional data. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features within small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in series while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening and rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in series and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on images collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural robots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the pipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real world positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides accessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference positions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or sophisticated imaging systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing Navigation And Chemical Application in Precision Agriculture With Deep Reinforcement Learning And Conditional Action Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17985v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based planning scheme for optimized robotic management of biotic stresses in precision agriculture. The framework employs a hierarchical decision-making structure with conditional action masking, where high-level actions direct the robot's exploration, while low-level actions optimize its navigation and efficient chemical spraying in affected areas. The key objectives of optimization include improving the coverage of infected areas with limited battery power and reducing chemical usage, thus preventing unnecessary spraying of healthy areas of the field. Our numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, Hierarchical Action Masking Proximal Policy Optimization (HAM-PPO), significantly outperforms baseline practices, such as LawnMower navigation + indiscriminate spraying (Carpet Spray), in terms of yield recovery and resource efficiency. HAM-PPO consistently achieves higher yield recovery percentages and lower chemical costs across a range of infection scenarios. The framework also exhibits robustness to observation noise and generalizability under diverse environmental conditions, adapting to varying infection ranges and spatial distribution patterns.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Investigating The Implications of Cyberattacks Against Precision Agricultural Equipment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16283v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As various technologies are integrated and implemented into the food and agricultural industry, it is increasingly important for stakeholders throughout the sector to identify and reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks associated with these technologies. However, numerous industry and government reports suggest that many farmers and agricultural equipment manufacturers do not fully understand the cyber threats posed by modern agricultural technologies, including CAN bus-driven farming equipment. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by attempting to quantify the cybersecurity risks associated with cyberattacks on farming equipment that utilize CAN bus technology. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents a hypothetical case study, using real-world data, to illustrate the specific and wider impacts of a cyberattack on a CAN bus-driven fertilizer applicator employed in row-crop farming. Second, it establishes a foundation for future research on quantifying cybersecurity risks related to agricultural machinery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 20th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (ICCWS 2025), Williamsburg, Virginia, USA</p></details> |
| **[Intelligent Agricultural Greenhouse Control System Based on Internet of Things and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09488v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study endeavors to conceptualize and execute a sophisticated agricultural greenhouse control system grounded in the amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. Through meticulous monitoring of intrinsic environmental parameters within the greenhouse and the integration of machine learning algorithms, the conditions within the greenhouse are aptly modulated. The envisaged outcome is an enhancement in crop growth efficiency and yield, accompanied by a reduction in resource wastage. In the backdrop of escalating global population figures and the escalating exigencies of climate change, agriculture confronts unprecedented challenges. Conventional agricultural paradigms have proven inadequate in addressing the imperatives of food safety and production efficiency. Against this backdrop, greenhouse agriculture emerges as a viable solution, proffering a controlled milieu for crop cultivation to augment yields, refine quality, and diminish reliance on natural resources [b1]. Nevertheless, greenhouse agriculture contends with a gamut of challenges. Traditional greenhouse management strategies, often grounded in experiential knowledge and predefined rules, lack targeted personalized regulation, thereby resulting in resource inefficiencies. The exigencies of real-time monitoring and precise control of the greenhouse's internal environment gain paramount importance with the burgeoning scale of agriculture. To redress this challenge, the study introduces IoT technology and machine learning algorithms into greenhouse agriculture, aspiring to institute an intelligent agricultural greenhouse control system conducive to augmenting the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production.</p></details> |  |

Based upon a cable driven robot architecture, by sharing the same roller-driven cable set with modular robotic arms, a fast-switching clamping mechanism allows each CAFE to clamp onto or release from the moving cables, enabling both independent and synchronized movement across the workspace. The methods developed to enable this system include the mechanical design, precise position control and a dynamic model for the spring-mass liked system, ensuring accurate and stable movement of the robotic arms. The system's scalability is further explored by studying the tension and sag in the cables to maintain performance as more robotic arms are deployed. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in tasks including pick-and-place showing its potential to contribute to agricultural automation.</p></details> |  |

Case studies and statistical insights illustrate the evolving landscape of AI driven smart farming, while future research directions also discusses challenges associated with data fusion for heterogeneous datasets. This review bridges the gap between AI research and agricultural applications, offering a roadmap for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to harness information fusion and ML for advancing precision agriculture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-Based Simulation of UAV Battery Recharging for IoT Applications: Precision Agriculture, Disaster Recovery, and Dengue Vector Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12685v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The low battery autonomy of Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) can make smart farming (precision agriculture), disaster recovery, and the fighting against dengue vector applications difficult. This article considers two approaches, first enumerating the characteristics observed in these three IoT application types and then modeling an UAV's battery recharge coordination using the Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approach. In this way, we propose that each drone inside the swarm does not communicate concerning this recharge coordination decision, reducing energy usage and permitting remote usage. A total of 6000 simulations were run to evaluate how two proposed policies, the BaseLine (BL) and ChargerThershold (CT) coordination recharging policy, behave in 30 situations regarding how each simulation sets conclude the simulation runs and how much time they work until recharging results. CT policy shows more reliable results in extreme system usage. This work conclusion presents the potential of these three IoT applications to achieve their perpetual service without communication between drones and ground stations. This work can be a baseline for future policies and simulation parameter enhancements.</p></details> | 22 pages |

DALL.E, an advanced AI image generator, works alongside ChatGPT's language processing to transform text descriptions and image clues into realistic visual representations of the content. The study used both approaches of image generation: text-to-image and image-to-image (variation). Six types of datasets depicting fruit crop environment were generated. These AI-generated images were then compared against ground truth images captured by sensors in real agricultural fields. The comparison was based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) metrics. The image-to-image generation exhibited a 5.78% increase in average PSNR over text-to-image methods, signifying superior image clarity and quality. However, this method also resulted in a 10.23% decrease in average FSIM, indicating a diminished structural and textural similarity to the original images. Similar to these measures, human evaluation also showed that images generated using image-to-image-based method were more realistic compared to those generated with text-to-image approach. The results highlighted DALL.E's potential in generating realistic agricultural image datasets and thus accelerating the development and adoption of imaging-based precision agricultural solutions. In future, DALL.E along with other alternative LLM based image generation models such as MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, Craiyon, Imagen, Parti, DreamStudio, Make-A-Scene, DeepDream, and VQ-GAN + CLIP could demonstrate further significant potential for enhancing image clarity, quality, and realism in depicting agricultural environments, which could revolutionize precision farming practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Fig...</summary><p>9 Figures, 1 table, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, ensuring reliable connectivity in diverse agricultural environments remains a critical challenge. This paper analyzes the performance trade offs between Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), specifically LoRaWAN, NBIoT, and Sigfox and cellular networks (4G and 5G) in agricultural applications. Beyond a comprehensive literature review, this study evaluates hybrid LPWAN and 5G architectures that integrate the strengths of both network types to enhance cost-efficiency and connectivity reliability. Using real-world case studies, the findings demonstrate that hybrid LPWAN and 5G models can reduce connectivity costs by up to 30% while significantly improving network reliability in remote agricultural settings. This work provides actionable recommendations for selecting optimal IoT connectivity solutions based on agricultural requirements and proposes future research directions to further optimize IoT infrastructure in smart farming.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 tables, and 2 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Force Aware Branch Manipulation To Assist Agricultural Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07497v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a methodology to safely manipulate branches to aid various agricultural tasks. Humans in a real agricultural environment often manipulate branches to perform agricultural tasks effectively, but current agricultural robots lack this capability. This proposed strategy to manipulate branches can aid in different precision agriculture tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, pollinating flowers under occlusion, and moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation. The proposed method modifies RRT* to plan a path that satisfies the branch geometric constraints and obeys branch deformable characteristics. Re-planning is done to obtain a path that helps the robot exert force within a desired range so that branches are not damaged during manipulation.

As global environmental challenges intensify, robotics offers a powerful solution to reduce chemical usage while meeting the increasing demands for food production. However, significant challenges remain in ensuring the autonomy and resilience of robots operating in unstructured agricultural environments. Obstacles such as crops and tall grass, which are deformable, must be identified as safely traversable, compared to rigid obstacles. To address this, we propose a new traversability analysis method based on a 3D spectral map reconstructed using a LIDAR and a multispectral camera. This approach enables the robot to distinguish between safe and unsafe collisions with deformable obstacles. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of multispectral metrics for vegetation detection and incorporate these metrics into an augmented environmental map. Utilizing this map, we compute a physics-based traversability metric that accounts for the robot's weight and size, ensuring safe navigation over deformable obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA25)</p></details> |
| **[DODA: Adapting Object Detectors to Dynamic Agricultural Environments in Real-Time with Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18334v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection has wide applications in agriculture, but domain shifts of diverse environments limit the broader use of the trained models. Existing domain adaptation methods usually require retraining the model for new domains, which is impractical for agricultural applications due to constantly changing environments. In this paper, we propose DODA ($D$iffusion for $O$bject-detection $D$omain Adaptation in $A$griculture), a diffusion-based framework that can adapt the detector to a new domain in just 2 minutes. DODA incorporates external domain embeddings and an improved layout-to-image approach, allowing it to generate high-quality detection data for new domains without additional training. We demonstrate DODA's effectiveness on the Global Wheat Head Detection dataset, where fine-tuning detectors on DODA-generated data yields significant improvements across multiple domains. DODA provides a simple yet powerful solution for agricultural domain adaptation, reducing the barriers for growers to use detection in personalised environments.

| **[A Dataset and Benchmark for Shape Completion of Fruits for Agricultural Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13304v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7,000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera intrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation of shape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05835v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionnaly, path_following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle's center along a predefined trajetory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the implement itself rather than vehicle's center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially inteded for rear axle's midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset points control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[JPDS-NN: Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Task Allocation for Agricultural Vehicle Routing Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02369v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Entrance Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (EDVRP) is a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the scale of cities influences routing outcomes, necessitating consideration of their entrances. This paper addresses EDVRP in agriculture, focusing on multi-parameter vehicle planning for irregularly shaped fields. To address the limitations of traditional methods, such as heuristic approaches, which often overlook field geometry and entrance constraints, we propose a Joint Probability Distribution Sampling Neural Network (JPDS-NN) to effectively solve the EDVRP. The network uses an encoder-decoder architecture with graph transformers and attention mechanisms to model routing as a Markov Decision Process, and is trained via reinforcement learning for efficient and rapid end-to-end planning. Experimental results indicate that JPDS-NN reduces travel distances by 48.4-65.4%, lowers fuel consumption by 14.0-17.6%, and computes two orders of magnitude faster than baseline methods, while demonstrating 15-25% superior performance in dynamic arrangement scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of cross-attention and pre-training. The framework enables scalable, intelligent routing for large-scale farming under dynamic constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

We present AgEval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing VLMs' capabilities in plant stress phenotyping, offering a solution to the challenge of limited annotated data in agriculture. Our study explores how general-purpose VLMs can be leveraged for domain-specific tasks with only a few annotated examples, providing insights into their behavior and adaptability. AgEval encompasses 12 diverse plant stress phenotyping tasks, evaluating zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning performance of state-of-the-art models including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA. Our results demonstrate VLMs' rapid adaptability to specialized tasks, with the best-performing model showing an increase in F1 scores from 46.24% to 73.37% in 8-shot identification. To quantify performance disparities across classes, we introduce metrics such as the coefficient of variation (CV), revealing that VLMs' training impacts classes differently, with CV ranging from 26.02% to 58.03%. We also find that strategic example selection enhances model reliability, with exact category examples improving F1 scores by 15.38% on average. AgEval establishes a framework for assessing VLMs in agricultural applications, offering valuable benchmarks for future evaluations. Our findings suggest that VLMs, with minimal few-shot examples, show promise as a viable alternative to traditional specialized models in plant stress phenotyping, while also highlighting areas for further refinement.

However, the lack of suitable garden spaces, demanding daily schedules and limited gardening expertise present major roadblocks for citizens looking to engage in urban gardening. While prior research has explored smart home solutions to support urban gardeners, these approaches currently do not fully address these practical barriers. In this paper, we present PlantPal, a system that enables the cultivation of garden spaces irrespective of one's location, expertise level, or time constraints. PlantPal enables the shared operation of a precision agriculture robot (PAR) that is equipped with garden tools and a multi-camera system. Insights from a 3-week deployment (N=18) indicate that PlantPal facilitated the integration of gardening tasks into daily routines, fostered a sense of connection with one's field, and provided an engaging experience despite the remote setting. We contribute design considerations for future robot-assisted urban gardening concepts.</p></details> |  |

In precision agriculture, accurate and synchronized data collection is crucial for effective analysis and decision making. Using principles of information theory, we can define conditions and parameters that influence the efficient transmission and processing of information. Existing technologies have limitations in maintaining consistent time references, handling node failures, and unreliable communication links, leading to inaccurate data readings. Reliable data storage is demanding now-a-days for storing data on local monitoring station as well as in online live server. Sometime internet is not working properly due to congestion and there is frequent packet loss. Current solutions often synchronize records based on database timestamps, leading to record duplication and waste storage. Both databases synchronize each other after internet restoration. By providing synchronization among nodes and data, accuracy and storage will be saved in IoT based WSNs for precision agriculture applications. A prototype Node-MCU internal memory is used as a resource for achieving data synchronization. This proposed work generates record ID from Node MCU EEPROM which helps in records synchronization if there is any packet loss at the local server or at the online server to maintain synchronization accuracy despite unreliable communication links. Experiment shows that for a particular duration Node MCU generated 2364 packets and packet loss at local server was 08 and at online server was 174 packets. Results shows that after synchronization 99.87% packets were synchronized. Using previous technique of timestamp, the redundancy was 70% which reduced to 0% using our proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures, 31 references</p></details> |

This scarcity is particularly problematic due to the dynamic nature of the environment and the evolving appearance of agricultural subjects as living things.

Utilizing a vineyard simulator based on the Unity engine, our system employs a cut-and-paste technique with geometrical consistency considerations to produce accurate photo-realistic images and labels from synthetic environments to train detection algorithms. This approach generates diverse data samples across various viewpoints and lighting conditions. We demonstrate considerable performance improvements in training a state-of-the-art detector by applying our method to table grapes cultivation.

But unlike general CV research, large high-quality public datasets are sparsely available. This can be partially attributed to the high variability between different agricultural tasks, crops and environments as well as the complexity of data collection, but it is also influenced by the reticence to publish datasets by many authors. This, as well as the lack of a widely used agricultural data repository, are impactful factors that hinder research in applied CV for agriculture as well as the usage of agricultural data in general-purpose CV research. In this survey, we provide a large number of high-quality datasets of images taken on fields.

This paper investigates a novel approach that leverages recent advances in extremely low-power wireless communication and sensing, as well as the rapidly increasing availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. By mounting a specialized wireless payload on a UAV, battery-less sensor tags can harvest wireless beacon signals emitted from the drone, dramatically reducing the cost per sensor. These tags can measure environmental information such as temperature and humidity, then encrypt and transmit the data in the range of several meters. An experimental implementation was constructed at AERPAW, an NSF-funded wireless aerial drone research platform. While ground-based tests confirmed reliable sensor operation and data collection, airborne trials encountered wireless interference that impeded successfully detecting tag data. Despite these challenges, our results suggest further refinements could improve reliability and advance precision agriculture and agrarian research.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by a conference</p></details> |

Effective weed management is especially important for crops with high worldwide production such as maize, to maximize crop yield for meeting increasing global demands. Advances in near-sensing and computer vision enable the development of new tools for weed management. Specifically, state-of-the-art segmentation models, coupled with novel sensing technologies, can facilitate timely and accurate weeding and monitoring systems. However, learning-based approaches require annotated data and show a lack of generalization to aerial imaging for different crops. We present a novel dataset for semantic and instance segmentation of crops and weeds in agricultural maize fields. The multispectral UAV-based dataset contains images with RGB, red-edge, and near-infrared bands, a large number of plant instances, dense annotations for maize and four weed classes, and is multitemporal. We provide extensive baseline results for both tasks, including probabilistic methods to quantify prediction uncertainty, improve model calibration, and demonstrate the approach's applicability to out-of-distribution data. The results show the effectiveness of the two additional bands compared to RGB only, and better performance in our target domain than models trained on existing datasets. We hope our dataset advances research on methods and operational systems for fine-grained weed identification, enhancing the robustness and applicability of UAV-based weed management.

In controlled laboratory settings, both the traditional HSV (Hue Saturation Value) transformation and the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model were employed. However, only YOLOv8 was utilised in outdoor experiments, as the HSV transformation was not capable of accurately drawing fruit contours. Experiments include ten distinct fruit patterns with six apples and six oranges. A grid structure for homography (perspective) transformation was employed to convert detected midpoints into 3D world coordinates. The experiments evaluated detection and localisation under varying lighting and background disturbances, revealing accurate performance indoors, but significant challenges outdoors. Our results show that indoor experiments using YOLOv8 achieved 100% detection accuracy, while outdoor conditions decreased performance, with an average accuracy of 69.15% for YOLOv8 under direct sunlight. The study demonstrates that real-world applications reveal significant limitations due to changing lighting, background disturbances, and colour and shape variability. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of algorithms and sensors to enhance the robustness of robotic harvesters for agricultural use.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Accurate detection of weeds at various growth stages is crucial for effective management yet challenging for farmers, as it requires identifying different species at multiple growth phases. This research addresses these challenges by utilizing advanced object detection models, specifically, the Detection Transformer (DETR) with a ResNet50 backbone and RetinaNet with a ResNeXt101 backbone, to identify and classify 16 weed species of economic concern across 174 classes, spanning their 11 weeks growth stages from seedling to maturity. A robust dataset comprising 203,567 images was developed, meticulously labeled by species and growth stage. The models were rigorously trained and evaluated, with RetinaNet demonstrating superior performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.907 on the training set and 0.904 on the test set, compared to DETR's mAP of 0.854 and 0.840, respectively. RetinaNet also outperformed DETR in recall and inference speed of 7.28 FPS, making it more suitable for real time applications. Both models showed improved accuracy as plants matured. This research provides crucial insights for developing precise, sustainable, and automated weed management strategies, paving the way for real time species specific detection systems and advancing AI-assisted agriculture through continued innovation in model development and early detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and Presented to ICMLA, 2024</p></details> |

However, understanding consumer engagement with CSA is fragmented, particularly in Japan where CSA participation is still emerging. This study aims to identify potential CSA participants in Japan and validate existing theories on CSA participation through a quantitative analysis of 2,484 Japanese consumers. Using choice experiments, Latent Class Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, we identified five distinct consumer segments. The "Sustainable Food Seekers" group showed the highest positive utility for CSA, driven primarily by "Food Education and Learning Opportunities" and "Contribution to Environmental and Social Issues." These factors were consistently significant across all segments, suggesting that many Japanese consumers value CSA for its educational and environmental benefits. In contrast, factors related to "Variety of Ingredients" were less influential in determining participation intentions. The findings suggest that promoting CSA in Japan may be most effective by emphasizing its role in environmental and social impact, rather than focusing solely on product attributes like organic certification, which is readily available in supermarkets. This reflects a key distinction between CSA adoption in Japan and in other cultural contexts, where access to organic produce is a primary driver. For "Sustainable Food Seekers," CSA offers a way to contribute to broader societal goals rather than just securing organic products.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |

This study constructs a tailored multispectral remote sensing dataset and an end-to-end framework for weed detection to advance precision agriculture practices. Unmanned aerial vehicles were used to collect raw multispectral data from two experimental areas (E2 and E8) over four years, covering 0.6046 km^{2} and ground truth annotations were created with GPS-enabled vehicles to manually label weeds and crops. The dataset is specifically designed for agricultural applications in Western Australia. We propose an end-to-end framework for weed detection that includes extensive preprocessing steps, such as denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and stitching. The proposed method combines vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI) with multispectral channels to form classification features, and employs several deep learning models to identify weeds based on the input features. Among these models, ResNet achieves the highest performance, with a weed detection accuracy of 0.9213, an F1-Score of 0.8735, an mIOU of 0.7888, and an mDC of 0.8865, validating the efficacy of the dataset and the proposed weed detection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, Accepted for oral presentation at IEEE 25th International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2024).

Along with the rapid development of satellite technologies in developed countries, new methods are being searched for accurate and operational identification of cultivated areas. In this context, identification of cropland boundaries based on spectral analysis of data obtained from satellite images is considered one of the most optimal and accurate methods in modern agriculture. This article proposes a new approach to determine the suitability and green index of cultivated areas using satellite data obtained through the "Google Earth Engine" (GEE) platform. In this approach, two powerful algorithms, "SNIC (Simple Non-Iterative Clustering) Super Pixels" and "Canny Edge Detection Method", are combined. The SNIC algorithm combines pixels in a satellite image into larger regions (super pixels) with similar characteristics, thereby providing better image analysis. The Canny Edge Detection Method detects sharp changes (edges) in the image to determine the precise boundaries of agricultural fields. This study, carried out using high-resolution multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API, has shown that the proposed method is effective in accurately and reliably classifying randomly selected agricultural fields. The combined use of these two tools allows for more accurate determination of the boundaries of agricultural fields by minimizing the effects of outliers in satellite images. As a result, more accurate and reliable maps can be created for agricultural monitoring and resource management over large areas based on the obtained data. By expanding the application capabilities of cloud-based platforms and artificial intelligence methods in the agricultural field.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

However, the adoption of such technologies is severely limited by the lack of broadband connectivity in rural areas. We argue that farming applications do not require permanent always-on connectivity. Instead, farming activity and digital agriculture applications follow seasonal rhythms of agriculture. Therefore, the need for connectivity is highly localized in time and space. We introduce BYON, a new connectivity model for high bandwidth agricultural applications that relies on emerging connectivity solutions like citizens broadband radio service (CBRS) and satellite networks. BYON creates an agile connectivity solution that can be moved along a farm to create spatio-temporal connectivity bubbles. BYON incorporates a new gateway design that reacts to the presence of crops and optimizes coverage in agricultural settings. We evaluate BYON in a production farm and demonstrate its benefits.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge faced by sustainable precision agriculture is weed growth, as weeds share essential resources with the crops, such as water, soil nutrients, and sunlight, which notably affect crop yields. The traditional methods employed to combat weeds include the usage of chemical herbicides and manual weed removal methods. However, these could damage the environment and pose health hazards. The adoption of automated computer vision technologies and ground agricultural consumer electronic vehicles in precision agriculture offers sustainable, low-carbon solutions. However, prior works suffer from issues such as low accuracy and precision and high computational expense. This work proposes EcoWeedNet, a novel model with enhanced weed detection performance without adding significant computational complexity, aligning with the goals of low-carbon agricultural practices. Additionally, our model is lightweight and optimal for deployment on ground-based consumer electronic agricultural vehicles and robots. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the CottonWeedDet12 benchmark dataset reflecting real-world scenarios. EcoWeedNet achieves performance close to that of large models yet with much fewer parameters. (approximately 4.21% of the parameters and 6.59% of the GFLOPs of YOLOv4). This work contributes effectively to the development of automated weed detection methods for next-generation agricultural consumer electronics featuring lower energy consumption and lower carbon footprint.

A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization.

As a result of this, the level of arable land is decreasing, as well as residential houses and industrial factories. The food crisis is becoming the main threat for us in the upcoming days. Because on the one hand, the population is increasing, and on the other hand, the amount of food crop production is decreasing due to the attack of diseases. Rice is one of the most significant cultivated crops since it provides food for more than half of the world's population. Bangladesh is dependent on rice (Oryza sativa) as a vital crop for its agriculture, but it faces a significant problem as a result of the ongoing decline in rice yield brought on by common diseases. Early disease detection is the main difficulty in rice crop cultivation. In this paper, we proposed our own dataset, which was collected from the Bangladesh field, and also applied deep learning and transfer learning models for the evaluation of the datasets. We elaborately explain our dataset and also give direction for further research work to serve society using this dataset. We applied a light CNN model and pre-trained InceptionNet-V2, EfficientNet-V2, and MobileNet-V2 models, which achieved 91.5% performance for the EfficientNet-V2 model of this work. The results obtained assaulted other models and even exceeded approaches that are considered to be part of the state of the art. It has been demonstrated by this study that it is possible to precisely and effectively identify diseases that affect rice leaves using this unbiased datasets. After analysis of the performance of different models, the proposed datasets are significant for the society for research work to provide solutions for decreasing rice leaf disease.</p></details> |  |

Recently, satellite technology has been improving rapidly and deep learning has seen much success in generic computer vision tasks and many application areas which presents an important opportunity to improve analysis of agricultural land. Here we present a systematic review of 150 studies to find the current uses of deep learning on satellite imagery for agricultural research. Although we identify 5 categories of agricultural monitoring tasks, the majority of the research interest is in crop segmentation and yield prediction. We found that, when used, modern deep learning methods consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across most tasks; the only exception was that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks did not consistently outperform Random Forests (RF) for yield prediction. The reviewed studies have largely adopted methodologies from generic computer vision, except for one major omission: benchmark datasets are not utilised to evaluate models across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Additionally, some studies have specifically utilised the extra spectral resolution available in satellite imagery, but other divergent properties of satellite images - such as the hugely different scales of spatial patterns - are not being taken advantage of in the reviewed studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures and 10 tables in main paper.

Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions.

Robots equipped with sensors and cameras can collect vast amounts of data on crop health, soil conditions, and weather patterns. Advanced analytics can then be applied to this data to make informed decisions, improving overall farm management. In this paper, we will demonstrate one approach to find the optimal coverage path of an agricultural field using a single robot, and one using multiple robots. For the single robot, we used a wavefront coverage algorithm that generates a sequence of locations that the robot needs to follow. For the multi-robot approach, the proposed approach consists of two steps: dividing the agricultural field into convex polygonal areas to optimally distribute them among the robots, and generating an optimal coverage path to ensure minimum coverage time for each of the polygonal areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The co-authors have asked to withdraw this paper, since it contains incomplete and incorrect informations</p></details> |

In this paper, we attempt to employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve the problem of 4WIS4WID mobile robot navigation in a structured, automated agricultural field. This paper consists of three sections: parameterization of four-wheel steering configurations, crop row tracking using DRL, and autonomous navigation of 4WIS4WID mobile robot using DRL through multiple crop rows. We show how to parametrize various configurations of four-wheel steering to two variables. This includes symmetric four-wheel steering, zero-turn, and an additional steering configuration that allows the 4WIS4WID mobile robot to move laterally. Using DRL, we also followed an irregularly shaped crop row with symmetric four-wheel steering. In the multiple crop row simulation environment, with the help of waypoints, we effectively performed point-to-point navigation. Finally, a comparative analysis of various DRL algorithms that use continuous actions was carried out.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, detailed spatial data on the global agricultural workforce have remained scarce. Here, we present a new gridded dataset that maps the global distribution of agricultural workers for every decade over the years 2000-2100, distributed at 0.083$\times$0.083 degrees resolution, roughly $\sim$10km$\times$10km at the Equator. The dataset is developed using an empirical modeling framework relying on generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) that integrate socioeconomic variables, including gross domestic product per capita, total population, rural population size, and agricultural land use. The predictions are consistent with Shared Socio-economic Pathways and we distribute full time series data for all SSPs 1 to 5. This dataset opens new avenues for future research on labour force health, productivity and risk, and could be very useful for developing informed, forward-looking strategies that address the challenges of climate resilience in agriculture.

This study investigates the potential application of various AI-powered, IoT-based, low-cost platforms for local weather forecasting to enable smart farming. Despite the increasing demand for this topic, a few promising studies have explored this area. This paper developed a conceptual research framework based on a systematic review of relevant literature and employed a case study method to validate the framework. The framework comprised five key components: the Data Acquisition Layer, Data Storage Layer, Data Processing Layer, Application Layer, and Decision-Making Layer. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the integration of AI-ML and IoT techniques for weather prediction tasks to support agriculture, and the incorporation of IoT technologies that provide real-time, high-resolution meteorological data, representing a step forward. Furthermore, this paper discusses key research gaps, such as the significant obstacles impeding the adoption of AI in agriculture and local weather forecasting, including the lack of straightforward solutions and the lack of digital skills among farmers, particularly those in rural areas.

Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI-2025 Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact (AISI) track</p></details> |

To assess the effectiveness of these mitigation policies, statistical methods must account for the heterogeneous impact of policies across different countries. We propose a Bayesian approach that combines the multinomial logit model, which is suitable for compositional land-use data, with a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) prior to cluster regions with similar policy impacts. To simultaneously control for other relevant factors, we distinguish between cluster-specific and global covariates, coining this approach the Bayesian nonparametric partial clustering model. We develop a novel and efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, leveraging recent advances in the Bayesian literature. Using economic, geographic, and subsidy-related data from 22 EU member states, we examine the effectiveness of policies influencing land-use decisions across Europe and highlight the diversity of the problem. Our results indicate that the impact of CAP varies widely across the EU, emphasizing the need for subsidies to be tailored to optimize their effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

This issue is considered to be the most important challenge for the next generation of agriculture due to the diminishing natural resources, the limited arable land, and unpredictable climatic conditions caused by climate change. In this paper, we employ emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve operational efficiency and productivity in the agricultural sector. Specifically, we propose an edge computing-based explainable crop recommendation system, AgroXAI, which suggests suitable crops for a region based on weather and soil conditions. In this system, we provide local and global explanations of ML model decisions with methods such as ELI5, LIME, SHAP, which we integrate into ML models. More importantly, we provide regional alternative crop recommendations with the counterfactual explainability method. In this way, we envision that our proposed AgroXAI system will be a platform that provides regional crop diversity in the next generation agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData), 10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Remote control technology, which leverages human intelligence and precise machine movements, ensures operator safety and boosts productivity. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in remote control applications by overcoming single-view limitations and providing three-dimensional information, yet most studies have not focused on agricultural settings. Therefore, to bridge the gap, this study proposes a large-scale digital mapping and immersive human-machine teleoperation framework specifically designed for precision agriculture. In this research, a DJI unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To accommodate the variability of complex textures, this method proposes an enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) approach. It integrates the open Multiple View Geometry (OpenMVG) framework with Local Features from Transformers (LoFTR). The enhanced SfM produces a point cloud map, which is further processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map model. For control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP/IP for VR control and positioning of agricultural machinery was introduced. This system offers a fully visual-based method for immersive control, allowing operators to utilize VR technology for remote operations. The experimental results demonstrate that the user-friendly remote control method also showcases its advantages over traditional video streaming-based remote operations, providing operators with a more comprehensive and immersive experience and a higher level of situational awareness.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

As the backbone of the global economy, agriculture confronts numerous challenges, with pests and diseases being particularly concerning due to their complexity, variability, rapid spread, and high resistance. This paper specifically addresses these issues. We construct the first multimodal instruction-following dataset in the agricultural domain, covering over 221 types of pests and diseases with approximately 400,000 data entries. This dataset aims to explore and address the unique challenges in pest and disease control. Based on this dataset, we propose a knowledge-infused training method to develop Agri-LLaVA, an agricultural multimodal conversation system. To accelerate progress in this field and inspire more researchers to engage, we design a diverse and challenging evaluation benchmark for agricultural pests and diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that Agri-LLaVA excels in agricultural multimodal conversation and visual understanding, providing new insights and approaches to address agricultural pests and diseases. By open-sourcing our dataset and model, we aim to promote research and development in LMMs within the agricultural domain and make significant contributions to tackle the challenges of agricultural pests and diseases.

| **[Adaptive LiDAR Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Agricultural Mobile Robots in Unmanned Farms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02899v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned and intelligent agricultural systems are crucial for enhancing agricultural efficiency and for helping mitigate the effect of labor shortage. However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles. Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.</p></details> |  |

Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.</p></details> |  |

For agricultural vehicles following reference paths on farmlands, especially during cross-furrow operations, a minimum deviation from the reference path is desired, in addition to the curvature constraints and body scale collision avoidance. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We propose the path-tracking Hybrid A*, which satisfies nonholonomic constraints and vehicle size collision avoidance, and devise new cost and heuristic functions to minimize the deviation degree. The path-tracking Hybrid A* can not only function in offline smoothing but also the real-time adjustment when confronted with unexpected obstacles. (2) We propose the hierarchical MPC to safely track the smoothed trajectory, using the initial solution solved by linearized MPC and nonlinear local adjustments around the initial solution. (3) We carry out extensive simulations with baseline comparisons based on real-world farm datasets to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, a scalable environment with flexible information access, easy communication, and real-time collaboration from all types of computing devices, including mobile handheld devices such as smartphones, PDAs and iPads, Geo-sensor devices, etc. are essential. The system must be accessible, scalable, and transparent from location, migration, and resources. In addition, the framework should support modern information retrieval and management systems, unstructured information to structured information processing, task prioritization, task distribution, workflow and task scheduling systems, processing power, and data storage. Thus, High Scalability Computing (HSC) or Cloud-based systems with Big data analytics can be a prominent and convincing solution for this circumstance.

We employ super-resolution to enhance the phenotypic characteristics of the synthesized images and their coherence with the corresponding generated masks. We showcase the utility of the proposed method for wheat head segmentation. The high quality of synthesized data underscores the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in generating image-mask pairs. Furthermore, models trained on our generated data exhibit promising performance when tested on an external, diverse dataset of real wheat fields. The results show the efficacy of the proposed methodology for addressing data scarcity for semantic segmentation tasks.

This paper explores various types of agriculture practiced in the area, including subsistence, commercial, intensive, extensive, industrial, organic, agroforestry, aquaculture, and urban agriculture. Each type presents unique challenges and opportunities, necessitating innovative approaches to enhance productivity and sustainability. To address these challenges, the integration of advanced technologies such as sensors and communication protocols is essential. Sensors can provide real-time data on soil health, moisture levels, and crop conditions, enabling farmers to make informed decisions. Communication technologies facilitate the seamless transfer of this data, allowing for timely interventions and optimized resource management. Moreover, programming techniques play a crucial role in developing applications that process and analyze agricultural data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, farmers can gain insights into crop performance, predict yields, and implement precision agriculture practices. This paper highlights the significance of combining traditional agricultural practices with modern technologies to create a resilient agricultural ecosystem. The findings underscore the potential of integrating sensors, communication technologies, and programming in transforming agricultural practices in Varanasi.

| **[Building Multi-Agent Copilot towards Autonomous Agricultural Data Management and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00188v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current agricultural data management and analysis paradigms are to large extent traditional, in which data collecting, curating, integration, loading, storing, sharing and analyzing still involve too much human effort and know-how. The experts, researchers and the farm operators need to understand the data and the whole process of data management pipeline to make fully use of the data. The essential problem of the traditional paradigm is the lack of a layer of orchestrational intelligence which can understand, organize and coordinate the data processing utilities to maximize data management and analysis outcome. The emerging reasoning and tool mastering abilities of large language models (LLM) make it a potentially good fit to this position, which helps a shift from the traditional user-driven paradigm to AI-driven paradigm. In this paper, we propose and explore the idea of a LLM based copilot for autonomous agricultural data management and analysis. Based on our previously developed platform of Agricultural Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), we build a proof-of-concept multi-agent system called ADMA Copilot, which can understand user's intent, makes plans for data processing pipeline and accomplishes tasks automatically, in which three agents: a LLM based controller, an input formatter and an output formatter collaborate together. Different from existing LLM based solutions, by defining a meta-program graph, our work decouples control flow and data flow to enhance the predictability of the behaviour of the agents. Experiments demonstrates the intelligence, autonomy, efficacy, efficiency, extensibility, flexibility and privacy of our system. Comparison is also made between ours and existing systems to show the superiority and potential of our system.</p></details> |  |

A new class of totally balanced games is introduced, which models the strategic interactions among companies processing agricultural products. The objective is to identify profit allocations that fairly compensate firms contributing to cost reduction and surplus processing for others. To achieve this, the allocations resulting from each type of compensation will be thoroughly examined, and a coalitionally stable compensation procedure will be established. The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative strategies for optimizing agricultural processes. Lastly, the findings will be applied to a case study.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to adapt to specific fields at low cost using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We explore a novel domain shift from a diverse, large pool of internet-sourced data to a small set of data collected by a robot at specific locations, minimizing the need for extensive on-field data collection. Additionally, we introduce a novel module -- the Multi-level Attention-based Adversarial Discriminator (MAAD) -- which can be integrated at the feature extractor level of any detection model. In this study, we incorporate MAAD with CenterNet to simultaneously detect leaf, stem, and vein instances. Our results show significant performance improvements in the unlabeled target domain compared to baseline models, with a 7.5% increase in object detection accuracy and a 5.1% improvement in keypoint detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[The unrealized potential of agroforestry for an emissions-intensive agricultural commodity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20882v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconciling agricultural production with climate-change mitigation and adaptation is one of the most formidable problems in sustainability. One proposed strategy for addressing this problem is the judicious retention of trees in agricultural systems. However, the magnitude of the current and future-potential benefit that trees contribute remains uncertain, particularly in the agricultural sector where trees can also limit production. Here we help to resolve these issues across a West African region responsible for producing $\approx$60% of the world's cocoa, a crop that contributes one of the highest per unit carbon footprints of all foods. We use machine learning to generate spatially-explicit estimates of shade-tree cover and carbon stocks across the region. We find that existing shade-tree cover is low, and not spatially aligned with climate threat. But we also find enormous unrealized potential for the sector to counterbalance a large proportion of their high carbon footprint annually, without threatening production. Our methods can be applied to other globally significant commodities that can be grown in agroforests, and align with accounting requirements of carbon markets, and emerging legislative requirements for sustainability reporting.</p></details> |  |
| **[KisanQRS: A Deep Learning-based Automated Query-Response System for Agricultural Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08883v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delivering prompt information and guidance to farmers is critical in agricultural decision-making. Farmers helpline centres are heavily reliant on the expertise and availability of call centre agents, leading to inconsistent quality and delayed responses. To this end, this article presents Kisan Query Response System (KisanQRS), a Deep Learning-based robust query-response framework for the agriculture sector. KisanQRS integrates semantic and lexical similarities of farmers queries and employs a rapid threshold-based clustering method. The clustering algorithm is based on a linear search technique to iterate through all queries and organize them into clusters according to their similarity. For query mapping, LSTM is found to be the optimal method. Our proposed answer retrieval method clusters candidate answers for a crop, ranks these answer clusters based on the number of answers in a cluster, and selects the leader of each cluster. The dataset used in our analysis consists of a subset of 34 million call logs from the Kisan Call Centre (KCC), operated under the Government of India. We evaluated the performance of the query mapping module on the data of five major states of India with 3,00,000 samples and the quantifiable outcomes demonstrate that KisanQRS significantly outperforms traditional techniques by achieving 96.58% top F1-score for a state. The answer retrieval module is evaluated on 10,000 samples and it achieves a competitive NDCG score of 96.20%. KisanQRS is useful in enabling farmers to make informed decisions about their farming practices by providing quick and pertinent responses to their queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAFA-Net: Region Attention Network For Food Items And Agricultural Stress Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12718v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have facilitated remarkable success in recognizing various food items and agricultural stress. A decent performance boost has been witnessed in solving the agro-food challenges by mining and analyzing of region-based partial feature descriptors. Also, computationally expensive ensemble learning schemes using multiple CNNs have been studied in earlier works. This work proposes a region attention scheme for modelling long-range dependencies by building a correlation among different regions within an input image. The attention method enhances feature representation by learning the usefulness of context information from complementary regions. Spatial pyramidal pooling and average pooling pair aggregate partial descriptors into a holistic representation. Both pooling methods establish spatial and channel-wise relationships without incurring extra parameters. A context gating scheme is applied to refine the descriptiveness of weighted attentional features, which is relevant for classification. The proposed Region Attention network for Food items and Agricultural stress recognition method, dubbed RAFA-Net, has been experimented on three public food datasets, and has achieved state-of-the-art performances with distinct margins. The highest top-1 accuracies of RAFA-Net are 91.69%, 91.56%, and 96.97% on the UECFood-100, UECFood-256, and MAFood-121 datasets, respectively. In addition, better accuracies have been achieved on two benchmark agricultural stress datasets. The best top-1 accuracies on the Insect Pest (IP-102) and PlantDoc-27 plant disease datasets are 92.36%, and 85.54%, respectively; implying RAFA-Net's generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

However, models trained on general everyday web-crawled data often exhibit sub-optimal performance for specialized domains, likely due to domain shift. Recent works have tackled this problem for some domains (e.g., healthcare) by constructing domain-specialized image-text data. However, constructing a dedicated large-scale image-text dataset for sustainable area of agriculture and livestock is still open to research. Further, this domain desires fine-grained feature learning due to the subtle nature of the downstream tasks (e.g, nutrient deficiency detection, livestock breed classification). To address this we present AgriCLIP, a vision-language foundational model dedicated to the domain of agriculture and livestock. First, we propose a large-scale dataset, named ALive, that leverages customized prompt generation strategy to overcome the scarcity of expert annotations. Our ALive dataset covers crops, livestock, and fishery, with around 600,000 image-text pairs. Second, we propose a training pipeline that integrates both contrastive and self-supervised learning to learn both global semantic and local fine-grained domain-specialized features. Experiments on diverse set of 20 downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of AgriCLIP framework, achieving an absolute gain of 7.8\% in terms of average zero-shot classification accuracy, over the standard CLIP adaptation via domain-specialized ALive dataset. Our ALive dataset and code can be accessible at \href{https://github.com/umair1221/AgriCLIP/tree/main}{Github}.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works on digital agriculture's own sustainability remain scarce, disregarding the environmental effects of deploying digital devices on a large-scale. We propose a bottom-up method to estimate the carbon footprint of digital agriculture scenarios considering deployment of devices over a diversity of farm sizes. It is applied to two use-cases and demonstrates that digital agriculture encompasses a diversity of devices with heterogeneous carbon footprints and that more complex devices yield higher footprints not always compensated by better performances or scaling gains. By emphasizing the necessity of considering the multiplicity of devices, and the territorial distribution of farm sizes when modelling digital agriculture deployments, this study highlights the need for further exploration of the first-order effects of digital technologies in agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Industrial Ecology, In press, 10.1111/jiec.13568</p></details> |

By utilizing sparse regression and Elastic-Net regularization techniques, the study identifies causal relationships between key remotely sensed variables-such as NDVI, precipitation, and temperature-and agricultural yield. To further enhance prediction accuracy, the first- and second-order dynamic transformations (velocity and acceleration) of these variables are applied, capturing non-linear patterns and delayed effects on yield. The findings highlight the improved predictive performance when combining regularization techniques with climatic and geospatial variables, enabling more precise forecasts of yield variability. The results confirm the existence of causal relationships in the Granger sense, emphasizing the value of this methodology for strategic agricultural management. This contributes to more efficient and sustainable production in paddy rice cultivation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) computer vision pipeline to evaluate a precision spraying system post-spraying without the need for traditional agricultural methods. The developed system can semantically segment potential targets such as lettuce, chickweed, and meadowgrass and correctly identify if targets have been sprayed. Furthermore, this pipeline evaluates using a domain-specific Weakly Supervised Deposition Estimation task, allowing for class-specific quantification of spray deposit weights in {\mu}L. Estimation of coverage rates of spray deposition in a class-wise manner allows for further understanding of effectiveness of precision spraying systems. Our study evaluates different Class Activation Mapping techniques, namely AblationCAM and ScoreCAM, to determine which is more effective and interpretable for these tasks. In the pipeline, inference-only feature fusion is used to allow for further interpretability and to enable the automation of precision spraying evaluation post-spray. Our findings indicate that a Fully Convolutional Network with an EfficientNet-B0 backbone and inference-only feature fusion achieves an average absolute difference in deposition values of 156.8 {\mu}L across three classes in our test set.

In agricultural settings, NeRFs can serve as digital twins, providing critical information about fruit detection for yield estimation and other important metrics for farmers. However, traditional NeRFs are not robust to challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light, extreme bright light and varying lighting. To address these issues, this work leverages three different sensors: an RGB camera, an event camera and a thermal camera. Our RGB scene reconstruction shows an improvement in PSNR and SSIM by +2.06 dB and +8.3% respectively. Our cross-spectral scene reconstruction enhances downstream fruit detection by +43.0% in mAP50 and +61.1% increase in mAP50-95. The integration of additional sensors leads to a more robust and informative NeRF. We demonstrate that our multi-modal system yields high quality photo-realistic reconstructions under various tree canopy covers and at different times of the day. This work results in the development of a resilient NeRF, capable of performing well in visibly degraded scenarios, as well as a learnt cross-spectral representation, that is used for automated fruit detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Remote sensing technology offers a cost-effective and efficient method for flood impact assessment. This study is aimed to assess the impact of flooding on crops and built-up areas. Landsat 9 imagery, European Space Agency-Land Use/Land Cover (ESA-LULC) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data are used to identify and quantify the extent of flood-affected areas, crop damage, and built-up area destruction. The findings indicate that Sindh, a province in Pakistan, suffered the most. This impact destroyed most Kharif season crops, typically cultivated from March to November. Using the SMAP satellite data, it is assessed that the high amount of soil moisture after flood also caused a significant delay in the cultivation of Rabi crops. The findings of this study provide valuable information for decision-makers and stakeholders involved in flood risk management and disaster response.</p></details> | AAAI Symposium 2024 |

Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Composite Visual-Laser Navigation Method Applied in Indoor Poultry Farming Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08431v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor poultry farms require inspection robots to maintain precise environmental control, which is crucial for preventing the rapid spread of disease and large-scale bird mortality. However, the complex conditions within these facilities, characterized by areas of intense illumination and water accumulation, pose significant challenges. Traditional navigation methods that rely on a single sensor often perform poorly in such environments, resulting in issues like laser drift and inaccuracies in visual navigation line extraction. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel composite navigation method that integrates both laser and vision technologies. This approach dynamically computes a fused yaw angle based on the real-time reliability of each sensor modality, thereby eliminating the need for physical navigation lines. Experimental validation in actual poultry house environments demonstrates that our method not only resolves the inherent drawbacks of single-sensor systems, but also significantly enhances navigation precision and operational efficiency. As such, it presents a promising solution for improving the performance of inspection robots in complex indoor poultry farming settings.</p></details> |  |

Captured by three ceiling-mounted visual sensors covering adjacent barn areas over seven days on a working dairy farm, the dataset comprises 101,329 images of 90 cows, plus underlying original CCTV footage. The dataset is provided with full computer vision recognition baselines, that is both a supervised and self-supervised learning framework for individual cow identification trained on cattle tracklets. We report a performance above 96% single image identification accuracy from the dataset and demonstrate that combining data from multiple cameras during learning enhances self-supervised identification. We show that our framework enables automatic cattle identification, barring only the simple human verification of tracklet integrity during data collection. Crucially, our study highlights that multi-camera, supervised and self-supervised components in tandem not only deliver highly accurate individual cow identification, but also achieve this efficiently with no labelling of cattle identities by humans. We argue that this improvement in efficacy has practical implications for livestock management, behaviour analysis, and agricultural monitoring. For reproducibility and practical ease of use, we publish all key software and code including re-identification components and the species detector with this paper, available at https://tinyurl.com/MultiCamCows2024.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.</p></details> |  |

While it is known that AI perpetuates biases against marginalized human groups, their impact on non-human animals remains understudied. We found that ChatGPT's text-to-image model (DALL-E 3) introduces a strong bias toward romanticizing livestock farming as dairy cows on pasture and pigs rooting in mud. This bias remained when we requested realistic depictions and was only mitigated when the automatic prompt revision was inhibited. Most farmed animal in industrialized countries are reared indoors with limited space per animal, which fail to resonate with societal values. Inhibiting prompt revision resulted in images that more closely reflected modern farming practices; for example, cows housed indoors accessing feed through metal headlocks, and pigs behind metal railings on concrete floors in indoor facilities. While OpenAI introduced prompt revision to mitigate bias, in the case of farmed animal production systems, it paradoxically introduces a strong bias towards unrealistic farming practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-loop model-predictive wind farm flow control under time-varying inflow using FLORIDyn](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02790v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven by the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually controlled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an open-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up precomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the other hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set points online, which makes them more flexible and resilient. This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller using the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated by a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter to continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel optimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to maximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table industry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without using a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying conditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4 % with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased measurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy control baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table controllers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to disturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive, data-driven framework for large-scale airborne infrared inspection of North American solar installations. Leveraging high-resolution thermal imagery, we construct and curate a geographically diverse dataset encompassing thousands of PV sites, enabling machine learning-based detection and localization of defects that are not detectable in the visible spectrum. Our pipeline integrates advanced image processing, georeferencing, and airborne thermal infrared anomaly detection to provide rigorous estimates of performance losses. We highlight practical considerations in aerial data collection, annotation methodologies, and model deployment across a wide range of environmental and operational conditions. Our work delivers new insights into the reliability of large-scale solar assets and serves as a foundation for ongoing research on performance trends, predictive maintenance, and scalable analytics in the renewable energy sector.</p></details> |  |

The model predicts the output power of the wind turbine under normal behaviour based on features retrieved from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Its advantages are that (i) it can be trained with SCADA data of at least a few years, (ii) it can incorporate all SCADA data of all wind turbines in a wind farm as features, (iii) it assumes that the output power follows a normal density with heteroscedastic variance and (iv) it can predict the output of one wind turbine by borrowing strength from the data of all other wind turbines in a farm. Probabilistic guidelines for condition monitoring are given via a cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart, which is specifically designed based on a real-data classification exercise and, hence, is adapted to the needs of a wind farm. We illustrate the performance of our model in a real SCADA data example which provides evidence that it outperforms other probabilistic prediction models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We have noticed that in some practical scenarios of VRP, the size of cities and their entrances can significantly influence the optimization process. To address this, we have constructed the Entrance Dependent VRP (EDVRP) to describe such problems. We provide a mathematical formulation for the EDVRP in farms and propose an Ordered Genetic Algorithm (OGA) to solve it. The effectiveness of OGA is demonstrated through our experiments, which involve a multitude of randomly generated cases. The results indicate that OGA offers certain advantages compared to a random strategy baseline and a genetic algorithm without ordering. Furthermore, the novel operators introduced in this paper have been validated through ablation experiments, proving their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of the algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Guidance, Navigation and Control (ICGNC) 2024</p></details> |

These data combined with historical records open the door for real-time field management improvements with the help of current advancements in computing power. However, despite these advances, the statistical design of experiments is rarely used to evaluate the performance of field management techniques accurately. Traditionally, randomized block design is prevalent in statistical designs of field trials, but in practice it is limited in dealing with large variations in soil classes, management practices, and crop varieties. More specifically, although this experimental design is suited for most trial types, it is not the optimal choice when multiple factors are tested over multifarious natural variations in farms, due to the economic constraints caused by the sheer number of variables involved. Experimental refinement is required to better estimate the effects of the primary factor in the presence of auxiliary factors. In this way, farmers can better understand the characteristics and limitations of the primary factor. This work presents a framework for automating the analysis of local field variations by fusing soil classification data and lidar topography data with historical yield. This framework will be leveraged to automate the designing of field experiments based on multiple topographic features</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This was presented at the ASABE 2023 AIM meeting with id: 2301158</p></details> |

Users can engage with live-streaming authors by participating in live chats, posting likes, or sending virtual gifts to convey their preferences and support. However, the live-streaming services faces serious data-sparsity problem, which can be attributed to the following two points: (1) User's valuable behaviors are usually sparse, e.g., like, comment and gift, which are easily overlooked by the model, making it difficult to describe user's personalized preference. (2) The main exposure content on our platform is short-video, which is 9 times higher than the exposed live-streaming, leading to the inability of live-streaming content to fully model user preference. To this end, we propose a Frequency-Aware Model for Cross-Domain Live-Streaming Recommendation, termed as FARM. Specifically, we first present the intra-domain frequency aware module to enable our model to perceive user's sparse yet valuable behaviors, i.e., high-frequency information, supported by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). To transfer user preference across the short-video and live-streaming domains, we propose a novel preference align before fuse strategy, which consists of two parts: the cross-domain preference align module to align user preference in both domains with contrastive learning, and the cross-domain preference fuse module to further fuse user preference in both domains using a serious of tailor-designed attention mechanisms.

Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offshore wind farm layout optimization using mathematical programming techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00476v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offshore wind power is a renewable energy of growing relevance in current electric energy systems, presenting favorable wind conditions in comparison with the sites on land. However, the higher energy yield has to compensate the increment in installation and maintenance costs, thus the importance of optimizing resources. One relevant aspect to increase profitability is the wind farm layout. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method to maximize the expected power production of offshore wind farms by setting the appropriate layout, i.e. minimizing the wake effects. The method uses a sequential procedure for global optimization consisting of two steps: i) an heuristic method to set an initial random layout configuration, and ii) the use of nonlinear mathematical programming techniques for local optimization, which use the random layout as an initial solution. The method takes full advantage of the most up-to-date mathematical programming techniques while performing a global optimization approach, which can be easily parallelized. The performance of the proposed procedure is tested using the German offshore wind farm Alpha Ventus, located in the North Sea, yielding an increment of expected annual power production of 3.52% with respect to the actual configuration. According to current electricity prices in Germany, this constitutes an expected profit increment of almost 1 M per year.</p></details> |  |

It is assumed that the operator manages a wind turbine plugged into a battery, which either provides or stores energy on demand to avoid ramp-up and ramp-down events. The battery stages, namely charging, discharging, or neutral, are modeled as a semi-Markov process. During each charging/discharging period, the energy stored/supplied is assumed to follow a modified Brownian bridge that depends on three parameters. We prove the validity of our methodology by testing the model on 10 years of real wind-power data and comparing real versus simulated results.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

| **[WFCRL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Wind Farm Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13592v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wind farm control problem is challenging, since conventional model-based control strategies require tractable models of complex aerodynamical interactions between the turbines and suffer from the curse of dimension when the number of turbines increases. Recently, model-free and multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches have been used to address this challenge. In this article, we introduce WFCRL (Wind Farm Control with Reinforcement Learning), the first open suite of multi-agent reinforcement learning environments for the wind farm control problem. WFCRL frames a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem: each turbine is an agent and can learn to adjust its yaw, pitch or torque to maximize the common objective (e.g. the total power production of the farm). WFCRL also offers turbine load observations that will allow to optimize the farm performance while limiting turbine structural damages. Interfaces with two state-of-the-art farm simulators are implemented in WFCRL: a static simulator (FLORIS) and a dynamic simulator (FAST.Farm). For each simulator, $10$ wind layouts are provided, including $5$ real wind farms. Two state-of-the-art online MARL algorithms are implemented to illustrate the scaling challenges. As learning online on FAST.Farm is highly time-consuming, WFCRL offers the possibility of designing transfer learning strategies from FLORIS to FAST.Farm.</p></details> |  |

Accordingly, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential to assess high frequency dynamics of the WECC system with integrated OWFs. Against this background, this paper presents the integration of detailed dynamic models of OWFs into a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD software. The sequential initialization technique is employed to facilitate the smooth initiation of a large-scale system in an EMT simulation. The performance of the configured model is assessed under wind speed variations and grounded faults, demonstrating the effectiveness of the miniWECC system with OWFs. This system serves as a valuable basic use case for validating the fast dynamic performance of future WECC systems with high penetration of wind energy.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[AI-Powered Cow Detection in Complex Farm Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02080v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animal welfare has become a critical issue in contemporary society, emphasizing our ethical responsibilities toward animals, particularly within livestock farming. The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically computer vision, offers an innovative approach to monitoring and enhancing animal welfare. Cows, as essential contributors to sustainable agriculture, are central to this effort. However, existing cow detection algorithms face challenges in real-world farming environments, such as complex lighting, occlusions, pose variations, and background interference, hindering detection. Model generalization is crucial for adaptation across contexts beyond the training dataset. This study addresses these challenges using a diverse cow dataset from six environments, including indoor and outdoor scenarios. We propose a detection model combining YOLOv8 with the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and assess its performance against baseline models, including Mask R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv8. Our findings show baseline models degrade in complex conditions, while our approach improves using CBAM. YOLOv8-CBAM outperformed YOLOv8 by 2.3% in mAP, achieving 95.2% precision and an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 82.6%, demonstrating superior accuracy. Contributions include (1) analyzing detection limitations, (2) proposing a robust model, and (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications include health monitoring, behavioral analysis, and tracking in smart farms, enabling precise detection in challenging settings. This study advances AI-driven livestock monitoring, improving animal welfare and smart agriculture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wind Speed Forecasting Based on Data Decomposition and Deep Learning Models: A Case Study of a Wind Farm in Saudi Arabia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13356v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With industrial and technological development and the increasing demand for electric power, wind energy has gradually become the fastest-growing and most environmentally friendly new energy source. Nevertheless, wind power generation is always accompanied by uncertainty due to the wind speed's volatility. Wind speed forecasting (WSF) is essential for power grids' dispatch, stability, and controllability, and its accuracy is crucial to effectively using wind resources. Therefore, this study proposes a novel WSF framework for stationary data based on a hybrid decomposition method and the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM) to achieve high forecasting accuracy for the Dumat Al-Jandal wind farm in Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. The hybrid decomposition method combines the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and the Seasonal Adjustment Method (SAM). The SAM method eliminates the seasonal component of the decomposed subseries generated by WPD to reduce forecasting complexity. The BiLSTM is applied to forecast all the deseasonalized decomposed subseries. Five years of hourly wind speed observations acquired from a location in the Al-Jouf region were used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. The comparative experimental results, including 27 other models, demonstrated the proposed model's superiority in single and multiple WSF with an overall average mean absolute error of 0.176549, root mean square error of 0.247069, and R-squared error of 0.985987.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Order Reduction of Large-Scale Wind Farms: A Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10088v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a data-driven algorithm for model order reduction (MOR) of large-scale wind farms and studies the effects that the obtained reduced-order model (ROM) has when this is integrated into the power grid. With respect to standard MOR methods, the proposed algorithm has the advantages of having low computational complexity and not requiring any knowledge of the high order model. Using time-domain measurements, the obtained ROM achieves the moment matching conditions at selected interpolation points (frequencies). With respect to the state of the art, the method achieves the so-called two-sided moment matching, doubling the accuracy by doubling the interpolated points. The proposed algorithm is validated on a combined model of a 200-turbine wind farm (which is reduced) interconnected to the IEEE 14-bus system (which represents the unreduced study area) by comparing the full-order model and the reduced-order model in terms of their Bode plots, eigenvalues and the point of common coupling voltages in extensive fault scenarios of the integrated power system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement learning-enhanced genetic algorithm for wind farm layout optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06803v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A reinforcement learning-enhanced genetic algorithm (RLGA) is proposed for wind farm layout optimization (WFLO) problems. While genetic algorithms (GAs) are among the most effective and accessible methods for WFLO, their performance and convergence are highly sensitive to parameter selections. To address the issue, reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced to dynamically select optimal parameters throughout the GA process. To illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed RLGA, we evaluate the WFLO problem for four layouts (aligned, staggered, sunflower, and unstructured) under unidirectional uniform wind, comparing the results with those from the GA. RLGA achieves similar results to GA for aligned and staggered layouts and outperforms GA for sunflower and unstructured layouts, demonstrating its efficiency. The sunflower and unstructured layouts' complexity highlights RLGA's robustness and efficiency in tackling complex problems. To further validate its capabilities, we investigate larger wind farms with varying turbine placements ($\Delta x = \Delta y = 5D$ and 2$D$, where $D$ is the wind turbine diameter) under three wind conditions: unidirectional, omnidirectional, and non-uniform, presenting greater challenges. The proposed RLGA is about three times more efficient than GA, especially for complex problems. This improvement stems from RL's ability to adjust parameters, avoiding local optima and accelerating convergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Edge-CNN-Transformer Model for Detecting Coordinated Cyber and Digital Twin Attacks in Cooperative Smart Farming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14729v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The agriculture sector is increasingly adopting innovative technologies to meet the growing food demands of the global population. To optimize resource utilization and minimize crop losses, farmers are joining cooperatives to share their data and resources among member farms. However, while farmers benefit from this data sharing and interconnection, it exposes them to cybersecurity threats and privacy concerns. A cyberattack on one farm can have widespread consequences, affecting the targeted farm as well as all member farms within a cooperative. In this research, we address existing gaps by proposing a novel and secure architecture for Cooperative Smart Farming (CSF). First, we highlight the role of edge-based DTs in enhancing the efficiency and resilience of agricultural operations. To validate this, we develop a test environment for CSF, implementing various cyberattacks on both the DTs and their physical counterparts using different attack vectors. We collect two smart farming network datasets to identify potential threats. After identifying these threats, we focus on preventing the transmission of malicious data from compromised farms to the central cloud server. To achieve this, we propose a CNN-Transformer-based network anomaly detection model, specifically designed for deployment at the edge. As a proof of concept, we implement this model and evaluate its performance by varying the number of encoder layers. Additionally, we apply Post-Quantization to compress the model and demonstrate the impact of compression on its performance in edge environments. Finally, we compare the model's performance with traditional machine learning approaches to assess its overall effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping Methane -- The Impact of Dairy Farm Practices on Emissions Through Satellite Data and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08766v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the correlation between dairy farm characteristics and methane concentrations as derived from satellite observations in Eastern Canada. Utilizing data from 11 dairy farms collected between January 2020 and December 2022, we integrated Sentinel-5P satellite methane data with critical farm-level attributes, including herd genetics, feeding practices, and management strategies. Initial analyses revealed significant correlations with methane concentrations, leading to the application of Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address multicollinearity and enhance model stability. Subsequently, machine learning models - specifically Random Forest and Neural Networks - were employed to evaluate feature importance and predict methane emissions. Our findings indicate a strong negative correlation between the Estimated Breeding Value (EBV) for protein percentage and methane concentrations, suggesting that genetic selection for higher milk protein content could be an effective strategy for emissions reduction. The integration of atmospheric transport models with satellite data further refined our emission estimates, significantly enhancing accuracy and spatial resolution. This research underscores the potential of advanced satellite monitoring, machine learning techniques, and atmospheric modeling in improving methane emission assessments within the dairy sector. It emphasizes the critical role of farm-specific characteristics in developing effective mitigation strategies. Future investigations should focus on expanding the dataset and incorporating inversion modeling for more precise emission quantification. Balancing ecological impacts with economic viability will be essential for fostering sustainable dairy farming practices.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

New York State alone anticipates offshore wind farms (WFs) contributing 9GW by 2035. Integration of energy storage emerges as crucial for this advancement. In this study, we focus on a WF paired with a captive battery energy storage system (BESS). We aim to ascertain the capacity credit for a BESS with specified energy and power ratings. Unlike prior methods rooted in reliability theory, we define a power alignment function, which leads to a straightforward definition of capacity and incremental capacity for the BESS. We develop a solution method based on a linear programming formulation. Our analysis utilizes wind data, collected by NYSERDA off Long Island's coast and load demand data from NYISO. Additionally, we present theoretical insights into BESS sizing and a key time-series property influencing BESS capacity, aiding in simulating wind and demand for estimating BESS energy requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention is All You Need to Optimize Wind Farm Operations and Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24052v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations and maintenance (O&M) is a fundamental problem in wind energy systems with far reaching implications for reliability and profitability. Optimizing O&M is a multi-faceted decision optimization problem that requires a careful balancing act across turbine level failure risks, operational revenues, and maintenance crew logistics. The resulting O&M problems are typically solved using large-scale mixed integer programming (MIP) models, which yield computationally challenging problems that require either long-solution times, or heuristics to reach a solution. To address this problem, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for wind farm O&M that builds on a multi-head attention (MHA) models, an emerging artificial intelligence methods that are specifically designed to learn in rich and complex problem settings. The development of proposed MHA framework incorporates a number of modeling innovations that allows explicit embedding of MIP models within an MHA structure. The proposed MHA model (i) significantly reduces the solution time from hours to seconds, (ii) guarantees feasibility of the proposed solutions considering complex constraints that are omnipresent in wind farm O&M, (iii) results in significant solution quality compared to the conventional MIP formulations, and (iv) exhibits significant transfer learning capability across different problem settings.</p></details> |  |

At its core, it asks whether there exists a tree that connects a set of sources (the leaves) to one sink (the root) such that certain capacity constraints at the inner nodes are satisfied. Our main algorithmic contribution is a dynamic program with various optimizations for Constrained Layer Tree. It outperforms the previously used MILP by multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, our experiments show that the somewhat abstract problem Constrained Layer Tree is actually the core of the cabling problem in solar farms, i.e., the feasible solution produced by our dynamic program can be used to bootstrap an MILP that can then find good solutions for the original cabling problem efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[FARM: Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02082v2)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into the representations. This strategic reduction in tokenization granularity is intentionally aligned with key drivers of functional properties (i.e., functional groups), enhancing the model's understanding of chemical language. By expanding the chemical lexicon, FARM more effectively bridges SMILES and natural language, ultimately advancing the model's capacity to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and by employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. By leveraging contrastive learning, FARM aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning, with promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Two-Stage Optimization Method for Real-Time Parameterization of PV-Farm Digital Twin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04244v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models of physical systems. This paper details a novel two-stage optimization method for real-time parameterization of photovoltaic digital twins (PVDTs) using field measurements. Initially, the method estimates equivalent irradiance from PV power, voltage, and current data, eliminating the need for direct irradiance sensors. This is crucial for tuning the DT's parameters to actual environmental conditions, thereby improving power prediction accuracy. The second stage focuses on refining these parameters by minimizing discrepancies between measured and predicted outputs. This optimization utilizes the estimated equivalent irradiance as a model input, maintaining synchronization with real-world conditions. Parameter updates are event-trigger, launched when deviations exceed predefined thresholds. This strategy optimizes prediction accuracy and manages communication loads efficiently. Validated with extensive data from a PV farm, this approach outperforms existing methodologies in predictive accuracy and operational efficiency, significantly improving the performance DTs in real-time grid operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This is already happening even for languages that do not have high-quality monolingual LLMs. We show that fine-tuning Llama (v1), mostly trained on English, on as little as 40K Italian news articles, is sufficient for producing news-like texts that native speakers of Italian struggle to identify as synthetic. We investigate three LLMs and three methods of detecting synthetic texts (log-likelihood, DetectGPT, and supervised classification), finding that they all perform better than human raters, but they are all impractical in the real world (requiring either access to token likelihood information or a large dataset of CFM texts). We also explore the possibility of creating a proxy CFM: an LLM fine-tuned on a similar dataset to one used by the real "content farm". We find that even a small amount of fine-tuning data suffices for creating a successful detector, but we need to know which base LLM is used, which is a major challenge. Our results suggest that there are currently no practical methods for detecting synthetic news-like texts 'in the wild', while generating them is too easy. We highlight the urgency of more NLP research on this problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of ACL 2024</p></details> |

| **[Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12873v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Towards Closing the Loop in Robotic Pollination for Indoor Farming via Autonomous Microscopic Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12311v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective pollination is a key challenge for indoor farming, since bees struggle to navigate without the sun. While a variety of robotic system solutions have been proposed, it remains difficult to autonomously check that a flower has been sufficiently pollinated to produce high-quality fruit, which is especially critical for self-pollinating crops such as strawberries. To this end, this work proposes a novel robotic system for indoor farming. The proposed hardware combines a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator arm with a custom end-effector, comprised of an endoscope camera, a 2-DOF microscope subsystem, and a custom vibrating pollination tool; this is paired with algorithms to detect and estimate the pose of strawberry flowers, navigate to each flower, pollinate using the tool, and inspect with the microscope. The key novelty is vibrating the flower from below while simultaneously inspecting with a microscope from above. Each subsystem is validated via extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoencoder-Based and Physically Motivated Koopman Lifted States for Wind Farm MPC: A Comparative Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06523v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the use of Autoencoder (AE) models to identify Koopman-based linear representations for designing model predictive control (MPC) for wind farms. Wake interactions in wind farms are challenging to model, previously addressed with Koopman lifted states. In this study we investigate the performance of two AE models: The first AE model estimates the wind speeds acting on the turbines these are affected by changes in turbine control inputs. The wind speeds estimated by this AE model are then used in a second step to calculate the power output via a simple turbine model based on physical equations. The second AE model directly estimates the wind farm output, i.e., both turbine and wake dynamics are modeled. The primary inquiry of this study addresses whether any of these two AE-based models can surpass previously identified Koopman models based on physically motivated lifted states. We find that the first AE model, which estimates the wind speed and hence includes the wake dynamics, but excludes the turbine dynamics outperforms the existing physically motivated Koopman model. However, the second AE model, which estimates the farm power directly, underperforms when the turbines' underlying physical assumptions are correct. We additionally investigate specific conditions under which the second, purely data-driven AE model can excel: Notably, when modeling assumptions, such as the wind turbine power coefficient, are erroneous and remain unchecked within the MPC controller. In such cases, the data-driven AE models, when updated with recent data reflecting changed system dynamics, can outperform physics-based models operating under outdated assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Conference on Decision and Control 2024</p></details> |
| **[Wind turbine condition monitoring based on intra- and inter-farm federated learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03672v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As wind energy adoption is growing, ensuring the efficient operation and maintenance of wind turbines becomes essential for maximizing energy production and minimizing costs and downtime. Many AI applications in wind energy, such as in condition monitoring and power forecasting, may benefit from using operational data not only from individual wind turbines but from multiple turbines and multiple wind farms. Collaborative distributed AI which preserves data privacy holds a strong potential for these applications. Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning approach in this context. We explore federated learning in wind turbine condition monitoring, specifically for fault detection using normal behaviour models. We investigate various federated learning strategies, including collaboration across different wind farms and turbine models, as well as collaboration restricted to the same wind farm and turbine model. Our case study results indicate that federated learning across multiple wind turbines consistently outperforms models trained on a single turbine, especially when training data is scarce. Moreover, the amount of historical data necessary to train an effective model can be significantly reduced by employing a collaborative federated learning strategy. Finally, our findings show that extending the collaboration to multiple wind farms may result in inferior performance compared to restricting learning within a farm, specifically when faced with statistical heterogeneity and imbalanced datasets.</p></details> |  |

For its high nutritional value on the one hand, and because it is an adequate species for insects in controlled environmental agriculture systems, on the other. Therefore, several models describing this larvae's behaviour have been developed in the literature. Due to the complex nature of living organisms, systems of controlled environment agriculture are characterised by their strong nonlinearities. In this paper, we present a three dimensional nonlinear model describing the black soldier fly dry biomass weight dynamic changes due to the temperature's influence. In practice, this biomass weight is not measured in real time. This becomes problematic for applying feedback control strategies that assume full information of the states. Thus, this work investigates the observability of the dry biomass of a Hermetia illucens farming batch. The instantaneous and global observability of the aforementioned model is proven by constructing an injective transformation between the state space and a higher dimensional space where the transformed states are observable.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 2024 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |

To predict the potential and scalability of emerging PV technologies, a global understanding of these systems' performance is essential. Traditionally, experimental and computational studies at large national research facilities have focused on PV performance in specific regional climates. However, synthesizing these regional studies to understand the worldwide performance potential has proven difficult. Given the expense of obtaining experimental data, the challenge of coordinating experiments at national labs across a politically-divided world, and the data-privacy concerns of large commercial operators, however, a fundamentally different, data-efficient approach is desired. Here, we present a physics-guided machine learning (PGML) scheme to demonstrate that: (a) The world can be divided into a few PV-specific climate zones, called PVZones, illustrating that the relevant meteorological conditions are shared across continents; (b) by exploiting the climatic similarities, high-quality monthly energy yield data from as few as five locations can accurately predict yearly energy yield potential with high spatial resolution and a root mean square error of less than 8 kWhm$^{2}$, and (c) even with noisy, heterogeneous public PV performance data, the global energy yield can be predicted with less than 6% relative error compared to physics-based simulations provided that the dataset is representative. This PGML scheme is agnostic to PV technology and farm topology, making it adaptable to new PV technologies or farm configurations. The results encourage physics-guided, data-driven collaboration among national policymakers and research organizations to build efficient decision support systems for accelerated PV qualification and deployment across the world.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting training data in this application field is particularly challenging and costly due to the need of acquiring information during the different growing stages of the cultivation of interest. In this paper, we present a method for data augmentation that uses two GANs to create artificial images to augment the training data. To obtain a higher image quality, instead of re-creating the entire scene, we take original images and replace only the patches containing objects of interest with artificial ones containing new objects with different shapes and styles. In doing this, we take into account both the foreground (i.e., crop samples) and the background (i.e., the soil) of the patches. Quantitative experiments, conducted on publicly available datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The source code and data discussed in this work are available as open source.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing farmers' requirements regarding Digital Farming (DF) technology remains a difficult task due to domain-specific challenges. Farmers form a diverse and international crowd of practitioners who use a common pool of agricultural products and services, which means we can consider the possibility of applying Crowd-based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE) for DF: CrowdRE4DF. We found that online user feedback in this domain is limited, necessitating a way of capturing user feedback from farmers in situ. Our solution, the Farmers' Voice application, uses speech-to-text, Machine Learning (ML), and Web 2.0 technology. A preliminary evaluation with five farmers showed good technology acceptance, and accurate transcription and ML analysis even in noisy farm settings.

Conducted within the unique agricultural context of Japan, characterized by small-scale, family-run farms and strong government protection policies, our study builds upon traditional theoretical frameworks that often oversimplify farmers' decision-making processes. By employing a scoping review, expert interviews, and a Modified Grounded Theory Approach, our research uncovers the intricate interplay between individual farmer values, farm management policies, social relations, agricultural policies, and livestock industry trends. We particularly highlight the unique dynamics within family-owned businesses, noting the tension between an "advanced management mindset" and "conservatism." Our study reveals that technology adoption is a sequential and iterative process, influenced by technology availability, farmers' digital literacy, technology implementation support, and observable technology impacts on animal health and productivity. These insights highlight the need for tailored support mechanisms and policies to enhance technology uptake, thereby promoting sustainable and efficient livestock production system.</p></details> | 58 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Concurrent Geometry, Control, and Layout Optimization of Wave Energy Converter Farms in Probabilistic Irregular Waves using Surrogate Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07098v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A promising direction towards improving the performance of wave energy converter (WEC) farms is to leverage a system-level integrated approach known as control co-design (CCD). A WEC farm CCD problem may entail decision variables associated with the geometric attributes, control parameters, and layout of the farm. However, solving the resulting optimization problem, which requires the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients through numerical methods such as multiple scattering (MS), is computationally prohibitive. To mitigate this computational bottleneck, we construct data-driven surrogate models (SMs) using artificial neural networks in combination with concepts from many-body expansion. The resulting SMs, developed using an active learning strategy known as query by committee, are validated through a variety of methods to ensure acceptable performance in estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients, (energy-related) objective function, and decision variables. To rectify inherent errors in SMs, a hybrid optimization strategy is devised. It involves solving an optimization problem with a genetic algorithm and SMs to generate a starting point that will be used with a gradient-based optimizer and MS. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by solving a series of optimization problems with increasing levels of integration. For a layout optimization study, the framework offers a 91-fold increase in computational efficiency compared to MS. Previously unexplored investigations of much further complexity are also performed, leading to a concurrent geometry, control, and layout optimization of WEC devices in probabilistic irregular waves. The scalability of the method is evaluated by increasing the farm size to include 25 devices. The results indicate promising directions toward a practical framework for integrated WEC farm design with more tractable computational demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 19 figures</p></details> |

Computer vision (CV) is indispensable in PLF by using cameras and computer algorithms to supplement or supersede manual efforts for livestock data acquisition. Data availability is crucial for developing innovative monitoring and analysis systems through artificial intelligence-based techniques. However, data curation processes are tedious, time-consuming, and resource intensive. This study presents the first systematic survey of publicly available livestock CV datasets (https://github.com/Anil-Bhujel/Public-Computer-Vision-Dataset-A-Systematic-Survey). Among 58 public datasets identified and analyzed, encompassing different species of livestock, almost half of them are for cattle, followed by swine, poultry, and other animals. Individual animal detection and color imaging are the dominant application and imaging modality for livestock. The characteristics and baseline applications of the datasets are discussed, emphasizing the implications for animal welfare advocates. Challenges and opportunities are also discussed to inspire further efforts in developing livestock CV datasets. This study highlights that the limited quantity of high-quality annotated datasets collected from diverse environments, animals, and applications, the absence of contextual metadata, are a real bottleneck in PLF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Control Co-design Using Graph-Based Optimization for Offshore Wind Farm Grid Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10365v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offshore wind farms have emerged as a popular renewable energy source that can generate substantial electric power with a low environmental impact. However, integrating these farms into the grid poses significant complexities. To address these issues, optimal-sized energy storage can provide potential solutions and help improve the reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the grid. Nevertheless, limited studies have attempted to perform energy storage sizing while including design and operations (i.e., control co-design) for offshore wind farms. As a result, the present work develops a control co-design optimization formulation to optimize multiple objectives and identify Pareto optimal solutions. The graph-based optimization framework is proposed to address the complexity of the system, allowing the optimization problem to be decomposed for large power systems. The IEEE-9 bus system is treated as an onshore AC grid with two offshore wind farms connected via a multi-terminal DC grid for our use case. The developed methodology successfully identifies the Pareto front during the control co-design optimization, enabling decision-makers to select the best compromise solution for multiple objectives.</p></details> |  |

Insights on aquaculture biosensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03859v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The AEFishBIT tri-axial accelerometer was externally attached to the operculum to assess the divergent activity and respiratory patterns of two marine farmed fish, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Analysis of raw data from exercised fish highlighted the large amplitude of operculum aperture and body tail movements in European sea bass, which were overall more stable at low-medium exercise intensity levels. Cosinor analysis in free-swimming fish (on-board data processing) highlighted a pronounced daily rhythmicity of locomotor activity and respiratory frequency in both gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. Acrophases of activity and respiration were coupled in gilthead sea bream, acting feeding time (once daily at 11:00 h) as a main synchronizing factor. By contrast, locomotor activity and respiratory frequency were out of phase in European sea bass with activity acrophase on early morning and respiration acrophase on the afternoon. The daily range of activity and respiration variation was also higher in European sea bass, probably as part of the adaptation of this fish species to act as a fast swimming predator. In any case, lower locomotor activity and enhanced respiration were associated with larger body weight in both fish species. This agrees with the notion that selection for fast growth in farming conditions is accompanied by a lower activity profile, which may favor an efficient feed conversion for growth purposes. Therefore, the use of behavioral monitoring is becoming a reliable and large-scale promising tool for selecting more efficient farmed fish, allowing researchers and farmers to establish stricter criteria of welfare for more sustainable and ethical fish production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Design for Wave Energy Converter Farms: Assessing Plant, Control, Layout, and Site Selection Coupling in the Presence of Irregular Waves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15717v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A promising direction towards reducing the levelized cost of energy for wave energy converter (WEC) farms is to improve their performance. WEC design studies generally focus on a single design domain (e.g., geometry, control, or layout) to improve the farm's performance under simplifying assumptions, such as regular waves. This strategy, however, has resulted in design recommendations that are impractical or limited in scope because WEC farms are complex systems that exhibit strong coupling among geometry, control, and layout domains. In addition, the location of the candidate site, which has a large impact on the performance of the farm, is often overlooked. Motivated by some of the limitations observed in WEC literature, this study uses an integrated design framework, based on simultaneous control co-design (CCD) principles, to discuss the impact of site selection and wave type on WEC farm design. Interactions among plant, control, and layout are also investigated and discussed using a wide range of simulations and optimization studies. All of the studies were conducted using frequency-domain heaving cylinder WEC devices within a farm with a linear reactive controller in the presence of irregular probabilistic waves. The results provide high-level guidelines to help the WEC design community move toward an integrated design perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

| **[Model predictive control of wakes for wind farm power tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16004v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a model predictive control scheme for wind farms is presented. Our approach considers wake dynamics including their influence on local wind conditions and allows to track a given power reference. In detail, a Gaussian wake model is used in combination with observation points that carry wind condition information. This allows to estimate the rotor effective wind speeds at downstream turbines based on which we deduce their power output. Through different approximation methods, the associated finite horizon nonlinear optimization problem is reformulated in a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program fashion. By solving the reformulated problem online, optimal yaw angles and axial induction factors are found. Closed-loop simulations indicate good power tracking capabilities over a wide range of power setpoints while distributing wind turbine infeed evenly among all units. Additionally, the simulation results underline real time capabilities of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Integrating renewable energy generation into dairy farming could help address this challenge. Effective battery management is important for integrating renewable energy generation. Managing battery charging and discharging poses significant challenges because of fluctuations in electrical consumption, the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation, and fluctuations in energy prices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly improve the use of renewable energy in dairy farming, however, there is limited research conducted in this particular domain. This research considers Ireland as a case study as it works towards attaining its 2030 energy strategy centered on the utilization of renewable sources. This study proposes a Q-learning-based algorithm for scheduling battery charging and discharging in a dairy farm setting. This research also explores the effect of the proposed algorithm by adding wind generation data and considering additional case studies. The proposed algorithm reduces the cost of imported electricity from the grid by 13.41%, peak demand by 2%, and 24.49% when utilizing wind generation. These results underline how reinforcement learning is highly effective in managing batteries in the dairy farming sector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Site-dependent Solutions of Wave Energy Converter Farms with Surrogate Models, Control Co-design, and Layout Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06794v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Design of wave energy converter farms entails multiple domains that are coupled, and thus, their concurrent representation and consideration in early-stage design optimization has the potential to offer new insights and promising solutions with improved performance. Concurrent optimization of physical attributes (e.g., plant) and the control system design is often known as control co-design or CCD. To further improve performance, the layout of the farm must be carefully optimized in order to ensure that constructive effects from hydrodynamic interactions are leveraged, while destructive effects are avoided. The variations in the joint probability distribution of waves, stemming from distinct site locations, affect the farm's performance and can potentially influence decisions regarding optimal plant selection, control strategies, and layout configurations. Therefore, this paper undertakes a concurrent exploration of control co-design and layout optimization for a farm comprising five devices, modeled as heaving cylinders in the frequency domain, situated across four distinct site locations: Alaskan Coasts, East Coast, Pacific Islands, and West Coast. The challenge of efficiently and accurately estimating hydrodynamic coefficients within the optimization loop was mitigated through the application of surrogate modeling and many-body expansion principles. Results indicate the optimized solutions exhibit variations in plant, control, and layout for each candidate site, signifying the importance of system-level design with environmental considerations from the early stages of the design process.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

However, the volatility and intermittency of wind speed restrict the development of wind power. To improve the utilization of wind power, this study proposes a new wind speed prediction model based on data noise reduction technology, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Firstly, an adaptive data noise reduction algorithm P-SSA is proposed based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The original wind speed is decomposed into multiple subsequences by SSA and then reconstructed. When the Pearson correlation coefficient between the reconstructed sequence and the original sequence is greater than 0.99, other noise subsequences are deleted to complete the data denoising. Then, the receptive field of the samples is expanded through the causal convolution and dilated convolution of TCN, and the characteristics of wind speed change are extracted. Then, the time feature information of the sequence is extracted by GRU, and then the wind speed is predicted to form the wind speed sequence prediction model of P-SSA-TCN-GRU. The proposed model was validated on three wind farms in Shandong Province. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model is better than that of the traditional model and other models based on TCN, and the wind speed prediction of wind farms with high precision and strong stability is realized. The wind speed predictions of this model have the potential to become the data that support the operation and management of wind farms.

However, the management of these models still needs to be improved, and new tools and technologies are required to handle the deployment and control of solar facilities. This work introduces a novel framework named Cloud-based Analysis and Integration for Data Efficiency (CAIDE), designed for real-time monitoring, management, and forecasting of solar irradiance sensor farms. CAIDE is designed to manage multiple sensor farms simultaneously while improving predictive models in real-time using well-grounded Modeling and Simulation (M&S) methodologies. The framework leverages Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to support the deployment and analysis of solar plants in dynamic environments. The system can adapt and re-train the model when given incorrect results, ensuring that forecasts remain accurate and up-to-date. Furthermore, CAIDE can be executed in sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, assuring scalability. The effectiveness of CAIDE is demonstrated in a complex scenario composed of several solar irradiance sensor farms connected to a centralized management system. Our results show that CAIDE is scalable and effective in managing and forecasting solar power production while improving the accuracy of predictive models in real time. The framework has important implications for the deployment of solar plants and the future of renewable energy sources.</p></details> |  |

In this scheme, the AC network of the OWF and the DRU has completely different synchronization mechanisms and power flow characteristics from the traditional power system. To optimize the power flow and reduce the net loss, this paper carries out the power flow modeling and optimization analysis for the DRU-HVDC transmission system with grid-forming OWFs. The influence of the DRU and the GFM wind turbines on the power flow of the system is analyzed. On this basis, improved constraint conditions are proposed and an optimal power flow (OPF) method is established. This method can minimize the power loss by adjusting the reactive power output of each wind turbine and internal network frequency. Finally, based on MATLAB, this paper uses YALMIP toolkit and CPLEX mathematical solver to realize the programming solution of the OPF model proposed in this paper.

In regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where 80\% of farms are small (under 2 ha in size), the task of mapping smallholder cropland is an important part of tracking sustainability measures such as crop productivity. However, the visually diverse and nuanced appearance of small farms has limited the effectiveness of traditional approaches to cropland mapping. Here we introduce a new approach based on the detection of harvest piles characteristic of many smallholder systems throughout the world. We present HarvestNet, a dataset for mapping the presence of farms in the Ethiopian regions of Tigray and Amhara during 2020-2023, collected using expert knowledge and satellite images, totaling 7k hand-labeled images and 2k ground-collected labels. We also benchmark a set of baselines, including SOTA models in remote sensing, with our best models having around 80\% classification performance on hand labelled data and 90\% and 98\% accuracy on ground truth data for Tigray and Amhara, respectively. We also perform a visual comparison with a widely used pre-existing coverage map and show that our model detects an extra 56,621 hectares of cropland in Tigray. We conclude that remote sensing of harvest piles can contribute to more timely and accurate cropland assessments in food insecure regions. The dataset can be accessed through https://figshare.com/s/45a7b45556b90a9a11d2, while the code for the dataset and benchmarks is publicly available at https://github.com/jonxuxu/harvest-piles</p></details> | submitted to AAAI24 |

This system equips animals, such as cattle, with solar sensors with computational capabilities, including Raspberry Pis, to train a local deep-learning model on health data. These sensors periodically update Long Range (LoRa) gateways, forming a wireless sensor network (WSN) to detect diseases like mastitis. Our proposed SusFL system incorporates mechanism design, a game theory concept, for intelligent client selection to optimize monitoring quality while minimizing energy use. This strategy ensures the system's sustainability and resilience against adversarial attacks, including data poisoning and privacy threats, that could disrupt FL operations. Through extensive comparative analysis using real-time datasets, we demonstrate that our FL-based monitoring system significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, operational efficiency, system reliability (i.e., mean time between failures or MTBF), and social welfare maximization by the mechanism designer.

The experimental results show that SusFL significantly improves system performance, including a $10\%$ reduction in energy consumption, a $15\%$ increase in social welfare, and a $34\%$ rise in Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), alongside a marginal increase in the global model's prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Adaptable Fine-Tune Distillation Framework For Advancing Farm Surveillance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07059v1)** | 2024-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose an automated framework for camel farm monitoring, introducing two key contributions: the Unified Auto-Annotation framework and the Fine-Tune Distillation framework. The Unified Auto-Annotation approach combines two models, GroundingDINO (GD), and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), to automatically annotate raw datasets extracted from surveillance videos. Building upon this foundation, the Fine-Tune Distillation framework conducts fine-tuning of student models using the auto-annotated dataset. This process involves transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a student model, resembling a variant of Knowledge Distillation. The Fine-Tune Distillation framework aims to be adaptable to specific use cases, enabling the transfer of knowledge from the large models to the small models, making it suitable for domain-specific applications. By leveraging our raw dataset collected from Al-Marmoom Camel Farm in Dubai, UAE, and a pre-trained teacher model, GroundingDINO, the Fine-Tune Distillation framework produces a lightweight deployable model, YOLOv8. This framework demonstrates high performance and computational efficiency, facilitating efficient real-time object detection.

The aim of this study was to design and validate a miniaturized tri-axial accelerometer for non-invasive monitoring of farmed fish with re-programmable schedule protocols.The device was attached to the operculum of gilthead sea bream and European sea bass juveniles for monitoring their physical activity by measurements of movement accelerations in x and y-axes, while records of operculum beats served as a measurement of respiratory frequency. Data post-processing of exercised fish in swimming test chambers revealed an exponential increase of fish accelerations with the increase of fish speed from 1 body-length to 4 body-lengths per second, while a close relationship between oxygen consumption and opercular frequency was consistently found.The usefulness of low computational load for data pre-processing with on-board algorithms was verified from low to submaximal exercise, increasing this procedure the autonomy of the system up to 6 h of data recording with different programmable schedules. Visual observations regarding tissue damage, feeding behavior and circulating levels of stress markers did not reveal at short term a negative impact of device tagging. Reduced plasma levels of triglycerides revealed a transient inhibition of feed intake in small fish, but this disturbance was not detected in larger fish. All this considered together is the proof of concept that miniaturized devices are suitable for non-invasive and reliable metabolic phenotyping of farmed fish to improve their overall performance and welfare. Further work is underway for improving the attachment procedure and the full device packaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Real-Time Dynamic Layout Optimization for Floating Offshore Wind Farm Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08484v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Downstream wind turbines operating behind upstream turbines face significant performance challenges due to reduced wind speeds and increased turbulence. This leads to decreased wind energy production and higher dynamic loads on downwind turbines. Consequently, real-time monitoring and control have become crucial for improving wind farm performance. One promising solution involves optimizing wind farm layouts in real-time, taking advantage of the added flexibility offered by floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs). This study explores a dynamic layout optimization strategy to minimize wake effects in wind farms while meeting power requirements. Two scenarios are considered: power maximization and power set-point tracking. The methodology involves a centralized wind farm controller optimizing the layout, followed by wind turbine controllers to meet the prescribed targets. Each FOWT employs model predictive control to adjust aerodynamic thrust force. The control strategy integrates a dynamic wind farm model that considers floating platform motion and wake transport in changing wind conditions. In a case study with a 1x3 wind farm layout of 5 MW FOWTs, the results show a 25% increase in stable energy production compared to a static layout in one hour for the first scenario. In the second scenario, desired power production was swiftly and consistently achieved.</p></details> |  |
| **[A techno-economic model for avoiding conflicts of interest between owners of offshore wind farms and maintenance suppliers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08251v1)** | 2024-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, wind energy is one of the most important sources of renewable energy. Offshore locations for wind turbines are increasingly exploited because of their numerous advantages. However, offshore wind farms require high investment in maintenance service. Due to its complexity and special requirements, maintenance service is usually outsourced by wind farm owners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to determine, quantify, and reduce the possible conflicts of interest between owners and maintenance suppliers. We created a complete techno-economic model to address this problem from an impartial point of view. An iterative process was developed to obtain statistical results that can help stakeholders negotiate the terms of the contract, in which the availability of the wind farm is the reference parameter by which to determine penalisations and incentives. Moreover, a multi-objective programming problem was addressed that maximises the profits of both parties without losing the alignment of their interests. The main scientific contribution of this paper is the maintenance analysis of offshore wind farms from two perspectives: that of the owner and the maintenance supplier. This analysis evaluates the conflicts of interest of both parties. In addition, we demonstrate that proper adjustment of some parameters, such as penalisation, incentives, and resources, and adequate control of availability can help reduce this conflict of interests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews (ELSEVIER) 10 July 2022.

This paper focuses on modelling the adoption rate of photovoltaic (PV) energy within the dairy sector in Ireland. An agent-based modelling approach is introduced to estimate the adoption rate. The model considers grid energy prices, revenue, costs, and maintenance expenses to calculate the probability of PV adoption. The ABM outputs estimate that by year 2022, 2.45% of dairy farmers have installed PV. This is a 0.45% difference to the actual PV adoption rate in year 2022. This validates the proposed ABM. The paper demonstrates the increasing interest in PV systems as evidenced by the rate of adoption, shedding light on the potential advantages of PV energy adoption in agriculture. This study possesses the potential to forecast future rates of PV energy adoption among dairy farmers. It establishes a groundwork for further research on predicting and understanding the factors influencing the adoption of renewable energy.</p></details> |  |

It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate change will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or more significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known as agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of raising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible for it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity. The agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging technologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors, smart farming transforms traditional production methods and international agricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is optimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The agricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the fourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods with cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and efficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the agriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities, and other stakeholders is necessary.

Employing intelligent automated precision livestock farming systems that can count animals, track the animals and their poses will raise productivity and significantly reduce the heavy burden on its already limited labor pool. To achieve such intelligent systems, a large cattle video dataset is essential in developing and training such models. However, many current animal datasets are tailored to few tasks or other types of animals, which result in poorer model performance when applied to cattle. Moreover, they do not provide top-down views of cattle. To address such limitations, we introduce CattleEyeView dataset, the first top-down view multi-task cattle video dataset for a variety of inter-related tasks (i.e., counting, detection, pose estimation, tracking, instance segmentation) that are useful to count the number of cows and assess their growth and well-being. The dataset contains 753 distinct top-down cow instances in 30,703 frames (14 video sequences). We perform benchmark experiments to evaluate the model's performance for each task.

The proposed model functions by encoding a wind farm into a fully-connected graph and processing the graph representation through a graph transformer. The graph transformer surrogate is shown to generalise well and is able to uncover latent structural patterns within the graph representation of wind farms.

Smart farming is a concept that involves the use of advanced technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices. Industry 4.0 and smart farming are closely related, as many of the technologies used in smart farming are also used in Industry 4.0. Digital twins have the potential for cost-effective software development of such applications. With our Digital Twin Prototype approach, all sensor interfaces are integrated into the development process, and their inputs and outputs of the emulated hardware match those of the real hardware. The emulators respond to the same commands and return identically formatted data packages as their real counterparts, making the Digital Twin Prototype a valid source of a digital shadow, i.e. the Digital Twin Prototype is a prototype of the physical twin and can replace it for automated testing of the digital twin software. In this paper, we present a case study for employing our Digital Twin Prototype approach to automated testing of software for improving the making of silage with a smart farming application. Besides automated testing with continuous integration, we also discuss continuous deployment of modular Docker containers in this context.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, conference, In the Proceedings Of The 2023 IEEE International Conference on Digital Twin (Digital Twin 2023)</p></details> |

| **[YOLO-RS: Remote Sensing Enhanced Crop Detection Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11165v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, crop classification and health detection based on deep learning have gradually become a research hotspot. However, the existing target detection methods show poor performance when dealing with small targets in remote sensing images, especially in the case of complex background and image mixing, which is difficult to meet the practical application requirementsite. To address this problem, a novel target detection model YOLO-RS is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the latest Yolov11 which significantly enhances the detection of small targets by introducing the Context Anchor Attention (CAA) mechanism and an efficient multi-field multi-scale feature fusion network. YOLO-RS adopts a bidirectional feature fusion strategy in the feature fusion process, which effectively enhances the model's performance in the detection of small targets. Small target detection. Meanwhile, the ACmix module at the end of the model backbone network solves the category imbalance problem by adaptively adjusting the contrast and sample mixing, thus enhancing the detection accuracy in complex scenes. In the experiments on the PDT remote sensing crop health detection dataset and the CWC crop classification dataset, YOLO-RS improves both the recall and the mean average precision (mAP) by about 2-3\% or so compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while the F1-score is also significantly improved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the model only increases by about 5.2 GFLOPs, indicating its significant advantages in both performance and efficiency. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and application potential of YOLO-RS in the task of detecting small targets in remote sensing images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-learning For Few-Shot Time Series Crop Type Classification: A Benchmark On The EuroCropsML Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11022v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial imbalances in crop type data pose significant challenges for accurate classification in remote sensing applications. Algorithms aiming at transferring knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce tasks have thus surged in popularity. However, despite their effectiveness in previous evaluations, their performance in challenging real-world applications is unclear and needs to be evaluated. This study benchmarks transfer learning and several meta-learning algorithms, including (First-Order) Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ((FO)-MAML), Almost No Inner Loop (ANIL), and Task-Informed Meta-Learning (TIML), on the real-world EuroCropsML time series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to simpler transfer learning methods when applied to crop type classification tasks in Estonia after pre-training on data from Latvia. However, this improvement comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, we find that the transfer of knowledge between geographically disparate regions, such as Estonia and Portugal, poses significant challenges to all investigated algorithms. These insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resource requirements in selecting machine learning methods for real-world crop type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of transferring knowledge between different regions of the Earth. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating transfer and meta-learning methods for crop type classification under real-world conditions. The corresponding code is publicly available at https://github.com/dida-do/eurocrops-meta-learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Remote Sensing Based Crop Health Classification Using NDVI and Fully Connected Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10522v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop health monitoring is not only essential for improving agricultural efficiency but also for ensuring sustainable food production in the face of environmental challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on visual inspection or simple NDVI measurements, which, though useful, fall short in detecting nuanced variations in crop stress and disease conditions. In this research, we propose a more sophisticated method that leverages NDVI data combined with a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) to classify crop health with greater precision. The FCNN, trained using satellite imagery from various agricultural regions, is capable of identifying subtle distinctions between healthy crops, rust-affected plants, and other stressed conditions. Our approach not only achieved a remarkable classification accuracy of 97.80% but it also significantly outperformed conventional models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-scores. The ability to map the relationship between NDVI values and crop health using deep learning presents new opportunities for real-time, large-scale monitoring of agricultural fields, reducing manual efforts, and offering a scalable solution to address global food security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cropper: Vision-Language Model for Image Cropping through In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07790v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of image cropping is to identify visually appealing crops in an image. Conventional methods are trained on specific datasets and fail to adapt to new requirements. Recent breakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable visual in-context learning without explicit training. However, downstream tasks with VLMs remain under explored. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for image cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for image cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we introduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted crops. The proposed framework, we refer to as Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of cropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and aspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Crop Yields Forecasts With Spatio-Temporal Conditional Copula Using Extreme Weather Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22807v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel forecasting model for crop yields that explicitly accounts for spatio-temporal dependence and the influence of extreme weather and climatic events. Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[iNatAg: Multi-Class Classification Models Enabled by a Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset with 4.7M Images of 2,959 Crop and Weed Species](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20068v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate identification of crop and weed species is critical for precision agriculture and sustainable farming. However, it remains a challenging task due to a variety of factors -- a high degree of visual similarity among species, environmental variability, and a continued lack of large, agriculture-specific image data. We introduce iNatAg, a large-scale image dataset which contains over 4.7 million images of 2,959 distinct crop and weed species, with precise annotations along the taxonomic hierarchy from binary crop/weed labels to specific species labels. Curated from the broader iNaturalist database, iNatAg contains data from every continent and accurately reflects the variability of natural image captures and environments. Enabled by this data, we train benchmark models built upon the Swin Transformer architecture and evaluate the impact of various modifications such as the incorporation of geospatial data and LoRA finetuning. Our best models achieve state-of-the-art performance across all taxonomic classification tasks, achieving 92.38\% on crop and weed classification. Furthermore, the scale of our dataset enables us to explore incorrect misclassifications and unlock new analytic possiblities for plant species. By combining large-scale species coverage, multi-task labels, and geographic diversity, iNatAg provides a new foundation for building robust, geolocation-aware agricultural classification systems. We release the iNatAg dataset publicly through AgML (https://github.com/Project-AgML/AgML), enabling direct access and integration into agricultural machine learning workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate is an evolving complex system with dynamic interactions and non-linear feedback mechanisms, shaping environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Crop production is highly sensitive to such climatic fluctuations. This paper studies the price volatility of agricultural crops as influenced by meteorological variables (and many other environmental, social and governance factors), which is a critical challenge in sustainable finance, agricultural planning, and policy-making. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states of Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns of crop prices from 2012 to 2024. This study further explores the cross-correlations between volatility and the meteorological variables. Further, a Granger-causality test is carried out to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the price volatility. Finally, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. We believe that this will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

The experiment started in 2020 (sowing fall 2019). In 2024 (sowing fall 2023), some of the cropping systems were modified. Analysis of this experiment may be done using linear mixed models. In order to include the data from 2020-2023 in joint analyses with the data collected for the modified systems from 2024 onwards, the mixed modelling approach needs to be reconsidered. In this paper, we develop models for this purpose. A key feature is the use of network meta-analytic concepts that allow a combination of direct and indirect comparisons among systems from the different years. The approach is first illustrated using a toy example. This is followed by detailed analyses of data from two the two trials sites Dahnsdorf and Hohenheim.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 15 Tables</p></details> |

Yet, issues like crop mislabeling and incorrect land identification are common. We propose a multi-level GT cleaning framework while utilizing multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data to address these issues. Specifically, this framework utilizes generating embeddings for farmland, clustering similar crop profiles, and identification of outliers indicating GT errors. We validated clusters with False Colour Composite (FCC) checks and used distance-based metrics to scale and automate this verification process. The importance of cleaning the GT data became apparent when the models were trained on the clean and unclean data. For instance, when we trained a Random Forest model with the clean GT data, we achieved upto 70\% absolute percentage points higher for the F1 score metric. This approach advances crop classification methodologies, with potential for applications towards improving loan underwriting and agricultural decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted In IEEE India Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (InGARSS) 2024</p></details> |

This study proposes FourCropNet, a novel deep learning model designed to detect diseases in multiple crops, including CottonLeaf, Grape, Soybean, and Corn. The model leverages an advanced architecture comprising residual blocks for efficient feature extraction, attention mechanisms to enhance focus on disease-relevant regions, and lightweight layers for computational efficiency. These components collectively enable FourCropNet to achieve superior performance across varying datasets and class complexities, from single-crop datasets to combined datasets with 15 classes. The proposed model was evaluated on diverse datasets, demonstrating high accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 scores. Notably, FourCropNet achieved the highest accuracy of 99.7% for Grape, 99.5% for Corn, and 95.3% for the combined dataset. Its scalability and ability to generalize across datasets underscore its robustness. Comparative analysis shows that FourCropNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models such as MobileNet, VGG16, and EfficientNet across various metrics.

Experimental results reveal that the Heuristic search achieves the fastest planning times (0.28 ms) and a 100% success rate, while the A* approach delivers near-optimal performance, and the DQN model, despite its adaptability, incurs longer planning delays and occasional suboptimal routing. These results highlight the advantages of deterministic rule-based methods in geometrically constrained crop-row environments and lay the groundwork for future hybrid strategies in precision agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to AGRICONTROL 2025 (Under Review)</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Benchmark Dataset and Model for Crop Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06973v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While conversational generative AI has shown considerable potential in enhancing decision-making for agricultural professionals, its exploration has predominantly been anchored in text-based interactions. The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications. The dataset is available at https: //github.com/UnicomAI/UnicomBenchmark/tree/main/CDDMBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024 (14 pages, 8 figures)</p></details> |
| **[WOFOSTGym: A Crop Simulator for Learning Annual and Perennial Crop Management Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19308v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WOFOSTGym, a novel crop simulation environment designed to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents to optimize agromanagement decisions for annual and perennial crops in single and multi-farm settings. Effective crop management requires optimizing yield and economic returns while minimizing environmental impact, a complex sequential decision-making problem well suited for RL. However, the lack of simulators for perennial crops in multi-farm contexts has hindered RL applications in this domain. Existing crop simulators also do not support multiple annual crops. WOFOSTGym addresses these gaps by supporting 23 annual crops and two perennial crops, enabling RL agents to learn diverse agromanagement strategies in multi-year, multi-crop, and multi-farm settings. Our simulator offers a suite of challenging tasks for learning under partial observability, non-Markovian dynamics, and delayed feedback. WOFOSTGym's standard RL interface allows researchers without agricultural expertise to explore a wide range of agromanagement problems. Our experiments demonstrate the learned behaviors across various crop varieties and soil types, highlighting WOFOSTGym's potential for advancing RL-driven decision support in agriculture.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Policies for Crop Planning Decision Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02057v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making their livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market saturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact their expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often provide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market dynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop planning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently without coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each farmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy, which jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization. Our results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with linear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower total rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the Multi-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes equitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more computational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents. ABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization, offering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL approaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning recommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric agricultural decision-making systems.</p></details> |  |

Effective weed management is especially important for crops with high worldwide production such as maize, to maximize crop yield for meeting increasing global demands. Advances in near-sensing and computer vision enable the development of new tools for weed management. Specifically, state-of-the-art segmentation models, coupled with novel sensing technologies, can facilitate timely and accurate weeding and monitoring systems. However, learning-based approaches require annotated data and show a lack of generalization to aerial imaging for different crops. We present a novel dataset for semantic and instance segmentation of crops and weeds in agricultural maize fields. The multispectral UAV-based dataset contains images with RGB, red-edge, and near-infrared bands, a large number of plant instances, dense annotations for maize and four weed classes, and is multitemporal. We provide extensive baseline results for both tasks, including probabilistic methods to quantify prediction uncertainty, improve model calibration, and demonstrate the approach's applicability to out-of-distribution data. The results show the effectiveness of the two additional bands compared to RGB only, and better performance in our target domain than models trained on existing datasets. We hope our dataset advances research on methods and operational systems for fine-grained weed identification, enhancing the robustness and applicability of UAV-based weed management.

The research focuses specifically on the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical remote sensing data from Sentinel 1, 2, and 3 satellites, and meteorological measurements such as surface temperature and rainfall. The initial field data for the study were acquired through Ernst & Young's (EY) Open Science Challenge 2023. The primary objective is to enhance the precision of crop yield prediction by developing a machine-learning framework capable of handling complex environmental data. A comprehensive data engineering process was employed to select the most informative features from over 100 potential predictors, reducing the set to 15 features from 5 distinct modalities. This step mitigates the ``curse of dimensionality" and enhances model performance. The RicEns-Net architecture combines multiple machine learning algorithms in a deep ensemble framework, integrating the strengths of each technique to improve predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that RicEns-Net achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 341 kg/Ha (roughly corresponds to 5-6\% of the lowest average yield in the region), significantly exceeding the performance of previous state-of-the-art models, including those developed during the EY challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

This study focuses on crop yield Time-Series Data prediction. Considering the crucial significance of agriculture in the global economy and social stability and the importance of accurate crop yield prediction for rational planting planning and decision-making, this research uses a dataset containing multiple crops, multiple regions, and data over many years to deeply explore the relationships between climatic factors (average rainfall, average temperature) and agricultural inputs (pesticide usage) and crop yield. Multiple hybrid machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, KNN, Decision Tree, and Bagging Regressor are adopted for yield prediction. After evaluation, it is found that the Random Forest and Bagging Regressor models perform excellently in predicting crop yield with high accuracy and low error.As agricultural data becomes increasingly rich and time-series prediction techniques continue to evolve, the results of this study contribute to advancing the practical application of crop yield prediction in agricultural production management. The integration of time-series analysis allows for more dynamic, data-driven decision-making, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of crop yield forecasts over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[TextureCrop: Enhancing Synthetic Image Detection through Texture-based Cropping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15500v4)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI technologies produce increasingly realistic imagery, which, despite its potential for creative applications, can also be misused to produce misleading and harmful content. This renders Synthetic Image Detection (SID) methods essential for identifying AI-generated content online. State-of-the-art SID methods typically resize or center-crop input images due to architectural or computational constraints, which hampers the detection of artifacts that appear in high-resolution images. To address this limitation, we propose TextureCrop, an image pre-processing component that can be plugged in any pre-trained SID model to improve its performance. By focusing on high-frequency image parts where generative artifacts are prevalent, TextureCrop enhances SID performance with manageable memory requirements. Experimental results demonstrate a consistent improvement in AUC across various detectors by 6.1% compared to center cropping and by 15% compared to resizing, across high-resolution images from the Forensynths, Synthbuster and TWIGMA datasets.

This raises concerns about the potential abuse of image generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly referred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable Diffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts and final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has shown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that these adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or input latents. Based on this, we propose CROPS (Circular or RandOm Prompts for Safety), a model-agnostic framework that easily defends against adversarial attacks generating NSFW images without requiring additional training. Moreover, we develop an approach that utilizes one-step diffusion models for efficient NSFW detection (CROPS-1), further reducing computational resources. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and applicability.</p></details> |  |

The core components are two object-detection models based on the YOLO deep learning architecture: a Bush Model that is able to detect blueberry bushes from images captured at low altitudes and at different angles, and a Berry Model that can detect individual berries that are visible on a bush. Together, both models allow for more accurate crop yield estimation by allowing intelligent control of the drone's position and camera to safely capture side-view images of bushes up close. In addition to providing experimental results for our models, which show good accuracy in terms of precision and recall when captured images are cropped around the foreground center bush, we also describe how to deploy our models to map out blueberry fields using different sampling strategies, and discuss the challenges of annotating very small objects (blueberries) and difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of our models.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Exploring Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Crop Yield Loss Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00502v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In response to climate change, assessing crop productivity under extreme weather conditions is essential to enhance food security. Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes, offer explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning (ML) models for crop modeling are powerful and scalable yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growths physical principles. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function. Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yield data, our model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</p></details> |

Annual maps of crop fields are key to understanding the nature of this transformation, but such maps are currently lacking and must be developed using advanced machine learning models trained on high resolution remote sensing imagery. To enable the development of such models, we delineated field boundaries in 33,746 Planet images captured between 2017 and 2023 across the continent using a custom labeling platform with built-in procedures for assessing and mitigating label error. We collected 42,403 labels, including 7,204 labels arising from tasks dedicated to assessing label quality (Class 1 labels), 32,167 from sites mapped once by a single labeller (Class 2) and 3,032 labels from sites where 3 or more labellers were tasked to map the same location (Class 4). Class 1 labels were used to calculate labeller-specific quality scores, while Class 1 and 4 sites mapped by at least 3 labellers were used to further evaluate label uncertainty using a Bayesian risk metric. Quality metrics showed that label quality was moderately high (0.75) for measures of total field extent, but low regarding the number of individual fields delineated (0.33), and the position of field edges (0.05). These values are expected when delineating small-scale fields in 3-5 m resolution imagery, which can be too coarse to reliably distinguish smaller fields, particularly in dense croplands, and therefore requires substantial labeller judgement. Nevertheless, previous work shows that such labels can train effective field mapping models. Furthermore, this large, probabilistic sample on its own provides valuable insight into regional agricultural characteristics, highlighting variations in the median field size and density. The imagery and vectorized labels along with quality information is available for download from two public repositories.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

This issue is considered to be the most important challenge for the next generation of agriculture due to the diminishing natural resources, the limited arable land, and unpredictable climatic conditions caused by climate change. In this paper, we employ emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve operational efficiency and productivity in the agricultural sector. Specifically, we propose an edge computing-based explainable crop recommendation system, AgroXAI, which suggests suitable crops for a region based on weather and soil conditions. In this system, we provide local and global explanations of ML model decisions with methods such as ELI5, LIME, SHAP, which we integrate into ML models. More importantly, we provide regional alternative crop recommendations with the counterfactual explainability method. In this way, we envision that our proposed AgroXAI system will be a platform that provides regional crop diversity in the next generation agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData), 10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

A recent challenge for weeding is the desire to reduce herbicide and pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity. In this paper, we introduce BonnBot-I a precise weed management platform which can also performs field monitoring. Driven by crop monitoring approaches that can accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry. This improves the tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a normalized average error of 8.3% to 3.5%, evaluated on a new publicly available corn dataset. We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments. We replicate weed distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which require significantly less movement (a 50% reduction) to achieve similar results. Overall, BonnBot-I is a significant step forward in precise weed management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in an arable field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2022 ...</summary><p>2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

However, the emergence of transformer networks in various vision tasks raises the question of whether they can outperform CNNs in this task as well. This paper presents a revised version of the Transformer-based Swin UNETR model, specifically adapted for crop segmentation of SITS. The proposed model demonstrates significant advancements, achieving a validation accuracy of 96.14% and a test accuracy of 95.26% on the Munich dataset, surpassing the previous best results of 93.55% for validation and 92.94% for the test. Additionally, the model's performance on the Lombardia dataset is comparable to UNet3D and superior to FPN and DeepLabV3. Experiments of this study indicate that the model will likely achieve comparable or superior accuracy to CNNs while requiring significantly less training time. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for crop segmentation in SITS, opening new avenues for remote sensing applications.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning-based multi-model called Climate-Management Aware Vision Transformer (CMAViT), designed for pixel-level vineyard yield predictions. CMAViT integrates both spatial and temporal data by leveraging remote sensing imagery and short-term meteorological data, capturing the effects of growing season variations. Additionally, it incorporates management practices, which are represented in text form, using a cross-attention encoder to model their interaction with time-series data. This innovative multi-modal transformer tested on a large dataset from 2016-2019 covering 2,200 hectares and eight grape cultivars including more than 5 million vines, outperforms traditional models like UNet-ConvLSTM, excelling in spatial variability capture and yield prediction, particularly for extreme values in vineyards. CMAViT achieved an R2 of 0.84 and a MAPE of 8.22% on an unseen test dataset. Masking specific modalities lowered performance: excluding management practices, climate data, and both reduced R2 to 0.73, 0.70, and 0.72, respectively, and raised MAPE to 11.92%, 12.66%, and 12.39%, highlighting each modality's importance for accurate yield prediction.

However, distinct patterns in human sensing, influenced by various factors or contexts, challenge the generic neural network model's performance due to natural distribution shifts. To address this, personalization tailors models to individual users. Yet most personalization studies overlook intra-user heterogeneity across contexts in sensory data, limiting intra-user generalizability. This limitation is especially critical in clinical applications, where limited data availability hampers both generalizability and personalization. Notably, intra-user sensing attributes are expected to change due to external factors such as treatment progression, further complicating the challenges. To address the intra-user generalization challenge, this work introduces CRoP, a novel static personalization approach. CRoP leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained models as generic starting points and captures user-specific traits through adaptive pruning on a minimal sub-network while preserving generic knowledge in the remaining parameters. CRoP demonstrates superior personalization effectiveness and intra-user robustness across four human-sensing datasets, including two from real-world health domains, underscoring its practical and social impact. Additionally, to support CRoP's generalization ability and design choices, we provide empirical justification through gradient inner product analysis, ablation studies, and comparisons against state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figues and 12 tables</p></details> |

Therefore, a scalable environment with flexible information access, easy communication, and real-time collaboration from all types of computing devices, including mobile handheld devices such as smartphones, PDAs and iPads, Geo-sensor devices, etc. are essential. The system must be accessible, scalable, and transparent from location, migration, and resources. In addition, the framework should support modern information retrieval and management systems, unstructured information to structured information processing, task prioritization, task distribution, workflow and task scheduling systems, processing power, and data storage. Thus, High Scalability Computing (HSC) or Cloud-based systems with Big data analytics can be a prominent and convincing solution for this circumstance.

However, current 3D reconstruction methods fail to recover complete shapes of plants due to heavy occlusion and complex geometries. In this work, we present a novel method for 3D reconstruction of agricultural crops based on optimizing a parametric model of plant morphology via inverse procedural modeling. Our method first estimates depth maps by fitting a neural radiance field and then employs Bayesian optimization to estimate plant morphological parameters that result in consistent depth renderings. The resulting 3D model is complete and biologically plausible. We validate our method on a dataset of real images of agricultural fields, and demonstrate that the reconstructions can be used for a variety of monitoring and simulation applications.</p></details> | Preprint |

This study aims to fill existing data gaps by employing two machine learning models, eXtreme Gradient Boosting and HistGradientBoosting algorithms to produce precise country-level predictions of nitrogen ($N$), phosphorus pentoxide ($P_2O_5$), and potassium oxide ($K_2O$) application rates. Subsequently, we created a comprehensive dataset of 5-arcmin resolution maps depicting the application rates of each fertilizer for 13 major crop groups from 1961 to 2019. The predictions were validated by both comparing with existing databases and by assessing the drivers of fertilizer application rates using the model's SHapley Additive exPlanations. This extensive dataset is poised to be a valuable resource for assessing fertilization trends, identifying the socioeconomic, agricultural, and environmental drivers of fertilizer application rates, and serving as an input for various applications, including environmental modeling, causal analysis, fertilizer price predictions, and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[CROPS: A Deployable Crop Management System Over All Possible State Availabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06034v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the optimal management strategy for nitrogen and irrigation has a significant impact on crop yield, economic profit, and the environment. To tackle this optimization challenge, this paper introduces a deployable \textbf{CR}op Management system \textbf{O}ver all \textbf{P}ossible \textbf{S}tate availabilities (CROPS). CROPS employs a language model (LM) as a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to explore optimal management strategies within the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulations. A distinguishing feature of this system is that the states used for decision-making are partially observed through random masking. Consequently, the RL agent is tasked with two primary objectives: optimizing management policies and inferring masked states. This approach significantly enhances the RL agent's robustness and adaptability across various real-world agricultural scenarios. Extensive experiments on maize crops in Florida, USA, and Zaragoza, Spain, validate the effectiveness of CROPS. Not only did CROPS achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results across various evaluation metrics such as production, profit, and sustainability, but the trained management policies are also immediately deployable in over of ten millions of real-world contexts. Furthermore, the pre-trained policies possess a noise resilience property, which enables them to minimize potential sensor biases, ensuring robustness and generalizability. Finally, unlike previous methods, the strength of CROPS lies in its unified and elegant structure, which eliminates the need for pre-defined states or multi-stage training. These advancements highlight the potential of CROPS in revolutionizing agricultural practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Crop Production Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04106v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop production management is essential for optimizing yield and minimizing a field's environmental impact to crop fields, yet it remains challenging due to the complex and stochastic processes involved. Recently, researchers have turned to machine learning to address these complexities. Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL), a cutting-edge approach designed to learn optimal decision-making strategies through trial and error in dynamic environments, has emerged as a promising tool for developing adaptive crop management policies. RL models aim to optimize long-term rewards by continuously interacting with the environment, making them well-suited for tackling the uncertainties and variability inherent in crop management. Studies have shown that RL can generate crop management policies that compete with, and even outperform, expert-designed policies within simulation-based crop models. In the gym-DSSAT crop model environment, one of the most widely used simulators for crop management, proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep Q-networks (DQN) have shown promising results. However, these methods have not yet been systematically evaluated under identical conditions. In this study, we evaluated PPO and DQN against static baseline policies across three different RL tasks, fertilization, irrigation, and mixed management, provided by the gym-DSSAT environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we used consistent default parameters, identical reward functions, and the same environment settings. Our results indicate that PPO outperforms DQN in fertilization and irrigation tasks, while DQN excels in the mixed management task. This comparative analysis provides critical insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, advancing the development of more effective RL-based crop management strategies.</p></details> | 10 pages |

These variations, coupled with differences in resolution, color, and contrast introduced by multiple remote imaging sensors, present substantial challenges for land use classification. The dataset is an interdisciplinary resource that spans multiple research domains, including remote sensing, geoinformatics, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. The unique features of the EcoCropsAID dataset offer opportunities for researchers to explore novel approaches, such as extracting spatial and temporal features, developing deep learning architectures, and implementing transformer-based models. The EcoCropsAID dataset provides a valuable platform for advancing research in land use classification, with implications for optimizing agricultural practices and enhancing sustainable development.

Accurate maps of where crops are grown are a key input to a number of downstream policy and research applications. In this proposal, we present preliminary work showing that it is possible to accurately classify crops from time series derived from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite imagery in Mexico using a pixel-based binary crop/non-crop time series transformer model. We also find preliminary evidence that meta-learning approaches supplemented with data from similar agro-ecological zones may improve model performance. Due to these promising results, we propose further development of this method with the goal of accurate multi-class crop classification in Jalisco, Mexico via meta-learning with a dataset comprising similar agro-ecological zones.</p></details> |  |

However, current measurement methods, which are labor-intensive, destructive, and imprecise, hinder large-scale quantification of this trait. To address this limitation, we present a biomass prediction network (BioNet), designed for adaptation across different data modalities, including point clouds and drone imagery. Our BioNet, utilizing a sparse 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and a transformer-based prediction module, processes point clouds and other 3D data representations to predict biomass. To further extend BioNet for drone imagery, we integrate a neural feature field (NeFF) module, enabling 3D structure reconstruction and the transformation of 2D semantic features from vision foundation models into the corresponding 3D surfaces. For the point cloud modality, BioNet demonstrates superior performance on two public datasets, with an approximate 6.1% relative improvement (RI) over the state-of-the-art. In the RGB image modality, the combination of BioNet and NeFF achieves a 7.9% RI. Additionally, the NeFF-based approach utilizes inexpensive, portable drone-mounted cameras, providing a scalable solution for large field applications.</p></details> |  |

We utilize masked autoencoders (MAEs) to learn a self-supervised embedding tailored for computer vision tasks in this domain. This embedding captures informative representations of histopathological data, facilitating feature learning without extensive labeled datasets. During pre-training, we investigate employing a random crop technique to generate a large dataset from WSIs automatically. Additionally, we assess the performance of linear probes for multi-class classification tasks of cancer sub-types using the representations learnt by the MAE. Our approach aims to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks by leveraging the complementary strengths of ViTs and autoencoders.

| **[CSGDN: Contrastive Signed Graph Diffusion Network for Predicting Crop Gene-phenotype Associations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07511v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positive and negative association prediction between gene and phenotype helps to illustrate the underlying mechanism of complex traits in organisms. The transcription and regulation activity of specific genes will be adjusted accordingly in different cell types, developmental stages, and physiological states. There are the following two problems in obtaining the positive/negative associations between gene and trait: 1) High-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing and phenotyping are expensive and time-consuming due to the need to process large sample sizes; 2) experiments introduce both random and systematic errors, and, meanwhile, calculations or predictions using software or models may produce noise. To address these two issues, we propose a Contrastive Signed Graph Diffusion Network, CSGDN, to learn robust node representations with fewer training samples to achieve higher link prediction accuracy. CSGDN employs a signed graph diffusion method to uncover the underlying regulatory associations between genes and phenotypes. Then, stochastic perturbation strategies are used to create two views for both original and diffusive graphs. Lastly, a multi-view contrastive learning paradigm loss is designed to unify the node presentations learned from the two views to resist interference and reduce noise. We conduct experiments to validate the performance of CSGDN on three crop datasets: Gossypium hirsutum, Brassica napus, and Triticum turgidum. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 9.28% AUC for link sign prediction in G. hirsutum dataset.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional crop management practices, often developed through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms, their application within crop management, and the use of crop management simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.</p></details> | 13 pages |

| **[GreenLight-Gym: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark Environment for Greenhouse Crop Production Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05336v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling greenhouse crop production systems is a complex task due to uncertain and non-linear dynamics between crops, indoor and outdoor climate, and economics. The declining number of skilled growers necessitates the development of autonomous greenhouse control systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach that can learn a control policy to automate greenhouse management. RL optimises a control policy through interactions with a model of the greenhouse while guided by an economic-based reward function. However, its application to real-world systems is limited due to discrepancies between models and real-world dynamics. Moreover, RL controllers may struggle to maintain state constraints while optimising the primary objective, especially when models inadequately capture the adverse effects of constraint violations on crop growth. Also, the generalisation to novel states, for example, due to unseen weather trajectories, is underexplored in RL-based greenhouse control. This work addresses these challenges through three key contributions. First, we present GreenLight-Gym, the first open-source environment designed for training and evaluating RL algorithms on the state-of-the-art greenhouse model GreenLight. GreenLight-Gym enables the community to benchmark RL-based control methodologies. Second, we compare two reward-shaping approaches, using either a multiplicative or additive penalty, to enforce state boundaries. The additive penalty achieves more stable training while better adhering to state constraints, while the multiplicative penalty yields marginally higher profits. Finally, we evaluate RL performance on a disjoint training and testing weather dataset, demonstrating improved generalisation to unseen conditions. Our environment and experiment scripts are open-sourced, facilitating innovative research on learning-based greenhouse control.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Convergence of CROP-Anderson Acceleration Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03970v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anderson Acceleration is a well-established method that allows to speed up or encourage convergence of fixed-point iterations. It has been successfully used in a variety of applications, in particular within the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) iteration method for quantum chemistry and physics computations. In recent years, the Conjugate Residual with OPtimal trial vectors (CROP) algorithm was introduced and shown to have a better performance than the classical Anderson Acceleration with less storage needed. This paper aims to delve into the intricate connections between the classical Anderson Acceleration method and the CROP algorithm. Our objectives include a comprehensive study of their convergence properties, explaining the underlying relationships, and substantiating our findings through some numerical examples. Through this exploration, we contribute valuable insights that can enhance the understanding and application of acceleration methods in practical computations, as well as the developments of new and more efficient acceleration schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 pages of Supplementary Materials</p></details> |
| **[SITSMamba for Crop Classification based on Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09673v2)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) data provides continuous observations over time, allowing for the tracking of vegetation changes and growth patterns throughout the seasons and years. Numerous deep learning (DL) approaches using SITS for crop classification have emerged recently, with the latest approaches adopting Transformer for SITS classification. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer poses challenges for classifying long time series. While the cutting-edge Mamba architecture has demonstrated strength in various domains, including remote sensing image interpretation, its capacity to learn temporal representations in SITS data remains unexplored. Moreover, the existing SITS classification methods often depend solely on crop labels as supervision signals, which fails to fully exploit the temporal information. In this paper, we proposed a Satellite Image Time Series Mamba (SITSMamba) method for crop classification based on remote sensing time series data. The proposed SITSMamba contains a spatial encoder based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Mamba-based temporal encoder. To exploit richer temporal information from SITS, we design two branches of decoder used for different tasks. The first branch is a crop Classification Branch (CBranch), which includes a ConvBlock to decode the feature to a crop map. The second branch is a SITS Reconstruction Branch that uses a Linear layer to transform the encoded feature to predict the original input values. Furthermore, we design a Positional Weight (PW) applied to the RBranch to help the model learn rich latent knowledge from SITS. We also design two weighting factors to control the balance of the two branches during training. The code of SITSMamba is available at: https://github.com/XiaoleiQinn/SITSMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design, Integration, and Field Evaluation of a Robotic Blossom Thinning System for Tree Fruit Crops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04919v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The US apple industry relies heavily on semi-skilled manual labor force for essential field operations such as training, pruning, blossom and green fruit thinning, and harvesting. Blossom thinning is one of the crucial crop load management practices to achieve desired crop load, fruit quality, and return bloom. While several techniques such as chemical, and mechanical thinning are available for large-scale blossom thinning such approaches often yield unpredictable thinning results and may cause damage the canopy, spurs, and leaf tissue. Hence, growers still depend on laborious, labor intensive and expensive manual hand blossom thinning for desired thinning outcomes. This research presents a robotic solution for blossom thinning in apple orchards using a computer vision system with artificial intelligence, a six degrees of freedom robotic manipulator, and an electrically actuated miniature end-effector for robotic blossom thinning. The integrated robotic system was evaluated in a commercial apple orchard which showed promising results for targeted and selective blossom thinning. Two thinning approaches, center and boundary thinning, were investigated to evaluate the system ability to remove varying proportion of flowers from apple flower clusters. During boundary thinning the end effector was actuated around the cluster boundary while center thinning involved end-effector actuation only at the cluster centroid for a fixed duration of 2 seconds. The boundary thinning approach thinned 67.2% of flowers from the targeted clusters with a cycle time of 9.0 seconds per cluster, whereas center thinning approach thinned 59.4% of flowers with a cycle time of 7.2 seconds per cluster. When commercially adopted, the proposed system could help address problems faced by apple growers with current hand, chemical, and mechanical blossom thinning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> |

Models for predicting 3D from a single image often work with crops around the object of interest and ignore the location of the object in the camera's field of view. We note that ignoring this location information further exaggerates the inherent ambiguity in making 3D inferences from 2D images and can prevent models from even fitting to the training data. To mitigate this ambiguity, we propose Intrinsics-Aware Positional Encoding (KPE), which incorporates information about the location of crops in the image and camera intrinsics. Experiments on three popular 3D-from-a-single-image benchmarks: depth prediction on NYU, 3D object detection on KITTI & nuScenes, and predicting 3D shapes of articulated objects on ARCTIC, show the benefits of KPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024, Project Page: https://ap229997.github.io/projects/ambiguity/</p></details> |

However, many existing methods depend on RTK-GPS devices, which can be susceptible to loss of radio signal or intermittent reception of corrections from the internet. Consequently, research has increasingly focused on using RGB cameras for crop-row detection, though challenges persist when dealing with grown plants. This paper introduces a LiDAR-based navigation system that can achieve crop-agnostic over-canopy autonomous navigation in row-crop fields, even when the canopy fully blocks the inter-row spacing. Our algorithm can detect crop rows across diverse scenarios, encompassing various crop types, growth stages, the presence of weeds, curved rows, and discontinuities. Without utilizing a global localization method (i.e., based on GPS), our navigation system can perform autonomous navigation in these challenging scenarios, detect the end of the crop rows, and navigate to the next crop row autonomously, providing a crop-agnostic approach to navigate an entire field. The proposed navigation system has undergone tests in various simulated and real agricultural fields, achieving an average cross-track error of 3.55cm without human intervention. The system has been deployed on a customized UGV robot, which can be reconfigured depending on the field conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025 (Under Review)</p></details> |

However, the accurate and scalable quantification of crop biomass remains inaccessible due to limitations in existing measurement methods. One of the obstacles impeding the advancement of current crop biomass prediction methodologies is the scarcity of publicly available datasets. Addressing this gap, we introduce a new dataset in this domain, i.e. Multi-modality dataset for crop biomass estimation (MMCBE). Comprising 216 sets of multi-view drone images, coupled with LiDAR point clouds, and hand-labelled ground truth, MMCBE represents the first multi-modality one in the field.

Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. The literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a methodological framework for researchers exploring crop classification through an MVL methodology.</p></details> | submitted to journal |

| **[Enhanced Infield Agriculture with Interpretable Machine Learning Approaches for Crop Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12426v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing popularity of Artificial Intelligence in recent years has led to a surge in interest in image classification, especially in the agricultural sector. With the help of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, the sector has undergone a significant transformation, leading to the development of new techniques for crop classification in the field. Despite the extensive research on various image classification techniques, most have limitations such as low accuracy, limited use of data, and a lack of reporting model size and prediction. The most significant limitation of all is the need for model explainability. This research evaluates four different approaches for crop classification, namely traditional ML with handcrafted feature extraction methods like SIFT, ORB, and Color Histogram; Custom Designed CNN and established DL architecture like AlexNet; transfer learning on five models pre-trained using ImageNet such as EfficientNetV2, ResNet152V2, Xception, Inception-ResNetV2, MobileNetV3; and cutting-edge foundation models like YOLOv8 and DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer Model. All models performed well, but Xception outperformed all of them in terms of generalization, achieving 98% accuracy on the test data, with a model size of 80.03 MB and a prediction time of 0.0633 seconds. A key aspect of this research was the application of Explainable AI to provide the explainability of all the models. This journal presents the explainability of Xception model with LIME, SHAP, and GradCAM, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in the models' predictions. This study highlights the importance of selecting the right model according to task-specific needs. It also underscores the important role of explainability in deploying AI in agriculture, providing insightful information to help enhance AI-driven crop management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Fusion of Optical and Radar Satellite Data for Crop Phenology Estimation using Machine Learning and Cloud Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00020v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop phenology determines crop growth stages and is valuable information for decision makers to plant and adapt agricultural management strategies to enhance food security. In the era of big Earth observation data ubiquity, attempts have been made to accurately predict crop phenology based on Remote Sensing (RS) data. However, most studies either focused on large scale interpretations of phenology or developed methods which are not adequate to help crop modeler communities on leveraging the value of RS data evaluated using more accurate and confident methods. Here, we estimate phenological developments for eight major crops and 13 phenological stages across Germany at 30m scale using a novel framework which fuses Landsat and Sentinel 2 (Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel data base; HLS) and radar of Sentinel 1 with a Machine Learning (ML) model. We proposed a thorough feature fusion analysis to find the best combinations of RS data on detecting phenological developments based on the national phenology network of Germany (German Meteorological Service; DWD) between 2017 and 2021. The nation-wide predicted crop phenology at 30 m resolution showed a very high precision of R2 > 0.9 and a very low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) < 2 (days). These results indicate that our fusing strategy of optical and radar datasets is highly performant with an accuracy highly relevant for practical applications, too. The subsequent uncertainty analysis indicated that fusing optical and radar data increases the reliability of the RS predicted crop growth stages. These improvements are expected to be useful for crop model calibrations and evaluations, facilitate informed agricultural decisions, and contribute to sustainable food production to address the increasing global food demand.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable predictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the performance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks. Our findings indicate a 2\% improvement in IoU compared to the traditional full-convolutional U-Net model in fewer GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals that some channels are irrelevant to this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 CVPPA Workshop</p></details> |

This paper implements centralized and decentralized federated learning frameworks for crop yield prediction based on Long Short-Term Memory Network. For centralized federated learning, multiple clients and one server is considered, where the clients exchange their model updates with the server that works as the aggregator to build the global model. For the decentralized framework, a collaborative network is formed among the devices either using ring topology or using mesh topology. In this network, each device receives model updates from the neighbour devices, and performs aggregation to build the upgraded model. The performance of the centralized and decentralized federated learning frameworks are evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and training time. The experimental results present that $\geq$97% and $>$97.5% prediction accuracy are achieved using the centralized and decentralized federated learning-based frameworks respectively. The results also show that the using centralized federated learning the response time can be reduced by $\sim$75% than the cloud-only framework.

| **[Shape and Style GAN-based Multispectral Data Augmentation for Crop/Weed Segmentation in Precision Farming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14119v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of deep learning methods for precision farming is gaining increasing interest. However, collecting training data in this application field is particularly challenging and costly due to the need of acquiring information during the different growing stages of the cultivation of interest. In this paper, we present a method for data augmentation that uses two GANs to create artificial images to augment the training data. To obtain a higher image quality, instead of re-creating the entire scene, we take original images and replace only the patches containing objects of interest with artificial ones containing new objects with different shapes and styles. In doing this, we take into account both the foreground (i.e., crop samples) and the background (i.e., the soil) of the patches. Quantitative experiments, conducted on publicly available datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The source code and data discussed in this work are available as open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Image Pre-Training with Siamese Cropped Masked Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17823v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised pre-training of image encoders is omnipresent in the literature, particularly following the introduction of Masked autoencoders (MAE). Current efforts attempt to learn object-centric representations from motion in videos. In particular, SiamMAE recently introduced a Siamese network, training a shared-weight encoder from two frames of a video with a high asymmetric masking ratio (95%). In this work, we propose CropMAE, an alternative approach to the Siamese pre-training introduced by SiamMAE. Our method specifically differs by exclusively considering pairs of cropped images sourced from the same image but cropped differently, deviating from the conventional pairs of frames extracted from a video. CropMAE therefore alleviates the need for video datasets, while maintaining competitive performances and drastically reducing pre-training and learning time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CropMAE learns similar object-centric representations without explicit motion, showing that current self-supervised learning methods do not learn such representations from explicit object motion, but rather thanks to the implicit image transformations that occur between the two views. Finally, CropMAE achieves the highest masking ratio to date (98.5%), enabling the reconstruction of images using only two visible patches. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexandre-eymael/CropMAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, 3 pages of supplementary material.

| **[XAI-Guided Enhancement of Vegetation Indices for Crop Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08298v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vegetation indices allow to efficiently monitor vegetation growth and agricultural activities. Previous generations of satellites were capturing a limited number of spectral bands, and a few expert-designed vegetation indices were sufficient to harness their potential. New generations of multi- and hyperspectral satellites can however capture additional bands, but are not yet efficiently exploited. In this work, we propose an explainable-AI-based method to select and design suitable vegetation indices. We first train a deep neural network using multispectral satellite data, then extract feature importance to identify the most influential bands. We subsequently select suitable existing vegetation indices or modify them to incorporate the identified bands and retrain our model. We validate our approach on a crop classification task. Our results indicate that models trained on individual indices achieve comparable results to the baseline model trained on all bands, while the combination of two indices surpasses the baseline in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2024</p></details> |
| **[Explainability of Sub-Field Level Crop Yield Prediction using Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08274v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop yield forecasting plays a significant role in addressing growing concerns about food security and guiding decision-making for policymakers and farmers. When deep learning is employed, understanding the learning and decision-making processes of the models, as well as their interaction with the input data, is crucial for establishing trust in the models and gaining insight into their reliability. In this study, we focus on the task of crop yield prediction, specifically for soybean, wheat, and rapeseed crops in Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany. Our goal is to develop and explain predictive models for these crops, using a large dataset of satellite images, additional data modalities, and crop yield maps. We employ a long short-term memory network and investigate the impact of using different temporal samplings of the satellite data and the benefit of adding more relevant modalities. For model explainability, we utilize feature attribution methods to quantify input feature contributions, identify critical growth stages, analyze yield variability at the field level, and explain less accurate predictions. The modeling results show an improvement when adding more modalities or using all available instances of satellite data. The explainability results reveal distinct feature importance patterns for each crop and region. We further found that the most influential growth stages on the prediction are dependent on the temporal sampling of the input data. We demonstrated how these critical growth stages, which hold significant agronomic value, closely align with the existing literature in agronomy and crop development biology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Resource Crop Classification from Multi-Spectral Time Series Using Lossless Compressors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18119v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of crop classification using multispectral temporal data. However, these models have complex structures with numerous parameters, requiring large amounts of data and costly training. In low-resource situations with fewer labeled samples, deep learning models perform poorly due to insufficient data. Conversely, compressors are data-type agnostic, and non-parametric methods do not bring underlying assumptions. Inspired by this insight, we propose a non-training alternative to deep learning models, aiming to address these situations. Specifically, the Symbolic Representation Module is proposed to convert the reflectivity into symbolic representations. The symbolic representations are then cross-transformed in both the channel and time dimensions to generate symbolic embeddings. Next, the Multi-scale Normalised Compression Distance (MNCD) is designed to measure the correlation between any two symbolic embeddings. Finally, based on the MNCDs, high quality crop classification can be achieved using only a k-nearest-neighbor classifier kNN. The entire framework is ready-to-use and lightweight. Without any training, it outperformed, on average, 7 advanced deep learning models trained at scale on three benchmark datasets. It also outperforms more than half of these models in the few-shot setting with sparse crop labels. Therefore, the high performance and robustness of our non-training framework makes it truly applicable to real-world crop mapping. Codes are available at: https://github.com/qinfengsama/Compressor-Based-Crop-Mapping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Pseudo-Labeling by Multi-Policy Viewfinder Network for Image Cropping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01971v2)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic image cropping models predict reframing boxes to enhance image aesthetics. Yet, the scarcity of labeled data hinders the progress of this task. To overcome this limitation, we explore the possibility of utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data together to expand the scale of training data for image cropping models. This idea can be implemented in a pseudo-labeling way: producing pseudo labels for unlabeled data by a teacher model and training a student model with these pseudo labels. However, the student may learn from teacher's mistakes. To address this issue, we propose the multi-policy viewfinder network (MPV-Net) that offers diverse refining policies to rectify the mistakes in original pseudo labels from the teacher. The most reliable policy is selected to generate trusted pseudo labels. The reliability of policies is evaluated via the robustness against box jittering. The efficacy of our method can be evaluated by the improvement compared to the supervised baseline which only uses labeled data. Notably, our MPV-Net outperforms off-the-shelf pseudo-labeling methods, yielding the most substantial improvement over the supervised baseline. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both the FCDB and FLMS datasets, signifying the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8figures |

Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Early Fusion, Cross Attention Fusion and Synchronized Class Token Fusion within the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art architectures with both convolutional and self-attention components.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

The predominant approaches in GS currently revolve around employing statistical methods for prediction. However, statistical methods often come with two main limitations: strong statistical priors and linear assumptions. A recent trend is to capture the non-linear relationships between markers by deep learning. However, as crop datasets are commonly long sequences with limited samples, the robustness of deep learning models, especially Transformers, remains a challenge. In this work, to unleash the unexplored potential of attention mechanism for the task of interest, we propose a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework that enables end-to-end training of the whole sequence. Via experiments on rice3k and wheat3k datasets, we show that, with simple tricks such as k-mer tokenization and random masking, Transformer can achieve overall superior performance against seminal methods on GS tasks of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2024.

| **[An Open and Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Modal Climate Change-aware Crop Yield Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06081v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise crop yield predictions are of national importance for ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural practices. While AI-for-science approaches have exhibited promising achievements in solving many scientific problems such as drug discovery, precipitation nowcasting, etc., the development of deep learning models for predicting crop yields is constantly hindered by the lack of an open and large-scale deep learning-ready dataset with multiple modalities to accommodate sufficient information. To remedy this, we introduce the CropNet dataset, the first terabyte-sized, publicly available, and multi-modal dataset specifically targeting climate change-aware crop yield predictions for the contiguous United States (U.S.) continent at the county level. Our CropNet dataset is composed of three modalities of data, i.e., Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, for over 2200 U.S. counties spanning 6 years (2017-2022), expected to facilitate researchers in developing versatile deep learning models for timely and precisely predicting crop yields at the county-level, by accounting for the effects of both short-term growing season weather variations and long-term climate change on crop yields. Besides, we develop the CropNet package, offering three types of APIs, for facilitating researchers in downloading the CropNet data on the fly over the time and region of interest, and flexibly building their deep learning models for accurate crop yield predictions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on our CropNet dataset via employing various types of deep learning solutions, with the results validating the general applicability and the efficacy of the CropNet dataset in climate change-aware crop yield predictions.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Improved Crop and Weed Detection with Diverse Data Ensemble Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01055v3)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern agriculture heavily relies on Site-Specific Farm Management practices, necessitating accurate detection, localization, and quantification of crops and weeds in the field, which can be achieved using deep learning techniques. In this regard, crop and weed-specific binary segmentation models have shown promise. However, uncontrolled field conditions limit their performance from one field to the other. To improve semantic model generalization, existing methods augment and synthesize agricultural data to account for uncontrolled field conditions. However, given highly varied field conditions, these methods have limitations. To overcome the challenges of model deterioration in such conditions, we propose utilizing data specific to other crops and weeds for our specific target problem. To achieve this, we propose a novel ensemble framework. Our approach involves utilizing different crop and weed models trained on diverse datasets and employing a teacher-student configuration. By using homogeneous stacking of base models and a trainable meta-architecture to combine their outputs, we achieve significant improvements for Canola crops and Kochia weeds on unseen test data, surpassing the performance of single semantic segmentation models. We identify the UNET meta-architecture as the most effective in this context. Finally, through ablation studies, we demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We observe that including base models trained on other target crops and weeds can help generalize the model to capture varied field conditions. Lastly, we propose two novel datasets with varied conditions for comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR Workshop as an Oral</p></details> |
| **[The Impact of Stocks on Correlations between Crop Yields and Prices and on Revenue Insurance Premiums using Semiparametric Quantile Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11805v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop yields and harvest prices are often considered to be negatively correlated, thus acting as a natural risk management hedge through stabilizing revenues. Storage theory gives reason to believe that the correlation is an increasing function of stocks carried over from previous years. Stock-conditioned second moments have implications for price movements during shortages and for hedging needs, while spatially varying yield-price correlation structures have implications for who benefits from commodity support policies. In this paper, we propose to use semi-parametric quantile regression (SQR) with penalized B-splines to estimate a stock-conditioned joint distribution of yield and price. The proposed method, validated through a comprehensive simulation study, enables sampling from the true joint distribution using SQR. Then it is applied to approximate stock-conditioned correlation and revenue insurance premium for both corn and soybeans in the United States. For both crops, Cornbelt core regions have more negative correlations than do peripheral regions. We find strong evidence that correlation becomes less negative as stocks increase. We also show that conditioning on stocks is important when calculating actuarially fair revenue insurance premiums. In particular, revenue insurance premiums in the Cornbelt core will be biased upward if the model for calculating premiums does not allow correlation to vary with stocks available. The stock-dependent correlation can be viewed as a form of tail dependence that, if unacknowledged, leads to mispricing of revenue insurance products.</p></details> |  |

We developed a prototype Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate interactions between humans and solitary bull Asian elephants in the Periyar-Agasthyamalai complex of the Western Ghats in Kerala, India. The main challenges were the complex behavior of elephants and insufficient movement data from the region. Using literature, expert insights, and field surveys, we created a prototype behavior model that incorporates crop habituation, thermoregulation, and aggression. We designed a four-step calibration method to adapt relocation data from radio-tagged elephants in Indonesia to model elephant movements in the model domain. The ABM's structure, including the assumptions, submodels, and data usage are detailed following the Overview, Design concepts, Details protocol. The ABM simulates various food availability scenarios to study elephant behavior and environmental impact on space use and conflict patterns. The results indicate that the wet months increase conflict and thermoregulation significantly influences elephant movements and crop raiding. Starvation and crop habituation intensify these patterns. This prototype ABM is an initial model that offers information on the development of a decision support system in wildlife management and will be further enhanced with layers of complexity and subtlety across various dimensions.

| **[Satellite Data Shows Resilience of Tigrayan Farmers in Crop Cultivation During Civil War](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10819v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Tigray War was an armed conflict that took place primarily in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia from November 3, 2020 to November 2, 2022. Given the importance of agriculture in Tigray to livelihoods and food security, determining the impact of the war on cultivated area is critical. However, quantifying this impact was difficult due to restricted movement within and into the region and conflict-driven insecurity and blockages. Using satellite imagery and statistical area estimation techniques, we assessed changes in crop cultivation area in Tigray before and during the war. Our findings show that cultivated area was largely stable between 2020-2021 despite the widespread impacts of the war. We estimated $1,132,000\pm133,000$ hectares of cultivation in pre-war 2020 compared to $1,217,000 \pm 132,000$ hectares in wartime 2021. Comparing changes inside and outside of a 5 km buffer around conflict events, we found a slightly higher upper confidence limit of cropland loss within the buffer (0-3%) compared to outside the buffer (0-1%). Our results support other reports that despite widespread war-related disruptions, Tigrayan farmers were largely able to sustain cultivation. Our study demonstrates the capability of remote sensing combined with machine learning and statistical techniques to provide timely, transparent area estimates for monitoring food security in regions inaccessible due to conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-band feature selection for maturity classification of specialty crops by hyperspectral imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09955v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The maturity classification of specialty crops such as strawberries and tomatoes is an essential agricultural downstream activity for selective harvesting and quality control (QC) at production and packaging sites. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have produced encouraging results in color images for maturity classification applications. However, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) outperforms methods based on color vision. Multivariate analysis methods and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deliver promising results; however, a large amount of input data and the associated preprocessing requirements cause hindrances in practical application. Conventionally, the reflectance intensity in a given electromagnetic spectrum is employed in estimating fruit maturity. We present a feature extraction method to empirically demonstrate that the peak reflectance in subbands such as 500-670 nm (pigment band) and the wavelength of the peak position, and contrarily, the trough reflectance and its corresponding wavelength within 671-790 nm (chlorophyll band) are convenient to compute yet distinctive features for the maturity classification. The proposed feature selection method is beneficial because preprocessing, such as dimensionality reduction, is avoided before every prediction. The feature set is designed to capture these traits. The best SOTA methods, among 3D-CNN, 1D-CNN, and SVM, achieve at most 90.0 % accuracy for strawberries and 92.0 % for tomatoes on our dataset. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA as it yields an accuracy above 98.0 % in strawberry and 96.0 % in tomato classification. A comparative analysis of the time efficiency of these methods is also conducted, which shows the proposed method performs prediction at 13 Frames Per Second (FPS) compared to the maximum 1.16 FPS attained by the full-spectrum SVM classifier.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint: Paper submitted to the special issue of "Computers and Electronics in Agriculture"</p></details> |

The "SMARD" project aims to strengthen the country's agricultural sector by giving farmers with the information and tools they need to solve common difficulties and increase productivity. The project provides farmers with information on crop care, seed selection, and disease management best practices, as well as access to tools for recognizing and treating crop diseases. Farmers can also contact the expert panel through text message, voice call, or video call to purchase fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides at low prices, as well as secure bank loans. The project's goal is to empower farmers and rural communities by providing them with the resources they need to increase crop yields. Additionally, the "SMARD" will not only help farmers and rural communities live better lives, but it will also have a good effect on the economy of the nation. Farmers are now able to recognize plant illnesses more quickly because of the application of machine learning techniques based on image processing categorization. Our experiments' results show that our system "SMARD" outperforms the cutting-edge web applications by attaining 97.3% classification accuracy and 96% F1-score in crop disease classification. Overall, our project is an important endeavor for the nation's agricultural sector because its main goal is to give farmers the information, resources, and tools they need to increase crop yields, improve economic outcomes, and improve livelihoods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSyncOA: Self-synchronizing Object-aligned Watermarking to Resist Cropping-paste Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03458v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern image processing tools have made it easy for attackers to crop the region or object of interest in images and paste it into other images. The challenge this cropping-paste attack poses to the watermarking technology is that it breaks the synchronization of the image watermark, introducing multiple superimposed desynchronization distortions, such as rotation, scaling, and translation. However, current watermarking methods can only resist a single type of desynchronization and cannot be applied to protect the object's copyright under the cropping-paste attack. With the finding that the key to resisting the cropping-paste attack lies in robust features of the object to protect, this paper proposes a self-synchronizing object-aligned watermarking method, called SSyncOA. Specifically, we first constrain the watermarked region to be aligned with the protected object, and then synchronize the watermark's translation, rotation, and scaling distortions by normalizing the object invariant features, i.e., its centroid, principal orientation, and minimum bounding square, respectively. To make the watermark embedded in the protected object, we introduce the object-aligned watermarking model, which incorporates the real cropping-paste attack into the encoder-noise layer-decoder pipeline and is optimized end-to-end. Besides, we illustrate the effect of different desynchronization distortions on the watermark training, which confirms the necessity of the self-synchronization process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other SOTAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures (Have been accepted by ICME 2024)</p></details> |

This is particularly true for cereal crops, like wheat and barley, that are staple food crops and occupy a globally significant portion of agricultural land. Even small improvements in weed management practices across these major food crops worldwide would yield considerable benefits for both the environment and global food security. Blackgrass is a major grass weed which causes particular problems in cereal crops in north-west Europe, a major cereal production area, because it has high levels of of herbicide resistance and is well adapted to agronomic practice in this region. With the use of machine vision and multispectral imaging, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods to identify blackgrass in wheat and barley crops. As part of this work, we provide a large dataset with which we evaluate several key aspects of blackgrass weed recognition. Firstly, we determine the performance of different CNN and transformer-based architectures on images from unseen fields. Secondly, we demonstrate the role that different spectral bands have on the performance of weed classification. Lastly, we evaluate the role of dataset size in classification performance for each of the models trialled. We find that even with a fairly modest quantity of training data an accuracy of almost 90% can be achieved on images from unseen fields.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Using a 10m resolution satellite-derived product, we created datasets of crop diversity across spatial and administrative scales for 27 EU countries and the UK in 2018. We define local crop diversity, or $\alpha$-diversity, at a 1km scale, corresponding to large or clusters of small-to-medium-sized farms. $\alpha$ crop diversities range from 2.3 to 4.4, with higher levels in systems with many small farms (averaging less than 10 ha). $\gamma$-diversity, the number and area of crops grown independently of location, increases from 2.85 at 1km to 3.86 at 10km, and levels off at 4.27 at 100km. These levels are higher than those reported in the U.S., possibly due to differences in farm structure and practices. $\beta$-diversity, the ratio of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ diversities, measures the difference between agroecosystems and ranges from 1.2 to 2.3 across EU countries. We classify countries' crop diversities into four groups based on the magnitude and change of $\gamma$-diversity across scales, with implications for regional to national agro-environmental policy recommendations. Continental Copernicus crop type maps will enable temporal comparisons, and exploring ecosystem co-variates will deepen our understanding of the link between crop diversity and agro-ecosystem services.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cross Domain Early Crop Mapping using CropSTGAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07398v2)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by abundant satellite imagery, machine learning-based approaches have recently been promoted to generate high-resolution crop cultivation maps to support many agricultural applications. One of the major challenges faced by these approaches is the limited availability of ground truth labels. In the absence of ground truth, existing work usually adopts the "direct transfer strategy" that trains a classifier using historical labels collected from other regions and then applies the trained model to the target region. Unfortunately, the spectral features of crops exhibit inter-region and inter-annual variability due to changes in soil composition, climate conditions, and crop progress, the resultant models perform poorly on new and unseen regions or years. Despite recent efforts, such as the application of the deep adaptation neural network (DANN) model structure in the deep adaptation crop classification network (DACCN), to tackle the above cross-domain challenges, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when there is a large dissimilarity between the source and target regions. This paper introduces the Crop Mapping Spectral-temporal Generative Adversarial Neural Network (CropSTGAN), a novel solution for cross-domain challenges, that doesn't require target domain labels. CropSTGAN learns to transform the target domain's spectral features to those of the source domain, effectively bridging large dissimilarities. Additionally, it employs an identity loss to maintain the intrinsic local structure of the data. Comprehensive experiments across various regions and years demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In experiments, CropSTGAN is benchmarked against various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Notably, CropSTGAN significantly outperforms these methods in scenarios with large data distribution dissimilarities between the target and source domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Generalization for Crop Segmentation with Standardized Ensemble Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01029v3)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, precision agriculture has gradually oriented farming closer to automation processes to support all the activities related to field management. Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by deploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting without human intervention. To execute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system that understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild. Existing methods, however, often fall short in generalizing to new crops and environmental conditions. This limit is critical for practical applications where labeled samples are rarely available. In this paper, we investigate the problem of crop segmentation and propose a novel approach to enhance domain generalization using knowledge distillation. In the proposed framework, we transfer knowledge from a standardized ensemble of models individually trained on source domains to a student model that can adapt to unseen realistic scenarios. To support the proposed method, we present a synthetic multi-domain dataset for crop segmentation containing plants of variegate species and covering different terrain styles, weather conditions, and light scenarios for more than 70,000 samples. We demonstrate significant improvements in performance over state-of-the-art methods and superior sim-to-real generalization.

Recent works have defined the subject-aware image cropping task as a nuanced and practical version of image cropping. We propose a weakly-supervised approach (GenCrop) to learn what makes a high-quality, subject-aware crop from professional stock images. Unlike supervised prior work, GenCrop requires no new manual annotations beyond the existing stock image collection. The key challenge in learning from this data, however, is that the images are already cropped and we do not know what regions were removed. Our insight is to combine a library of stock images with a modern, pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The stock image collection provides diversity and its images serve as pseudo-labels for a good crop, while the text-image diffusion model is used to out-paint (i.e., outward inpainting) realistic uncropped images. Using this procedure, we are able to automatically generate a large dataset of cropped-uncropped training pairs to train a cropping model. Despite being weakly-supervised, GenCrop is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods and significantly better than comparable weakly-supervised baselines on quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 24.

| **[Active learning for efficient annotation in precision agriculture: a use-case on crop-weed semantic segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02580v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing deep learning models requires large amounts of annotated images, a process that is both time-intensive and costly. Especially for semantic segmentation models in which every pixel must be annotated. A potential strategy to mitigate annotation effort is active learning. Active learning facilitates the identification and selection of the most informative images from a large unlabelled pool. The underlying premise is that these selected images can improve the model's performance faster than random selection to reduce annotation effort. While active learning has demonstrated promising results on benchmark datasets like Cityscapes, its performance in the agricultural domain remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a comparative study of three active learning-based acquisition functions: Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), stochastic-based BALD (PowerBALD), and Random. The acquisition functions were tested on two agricultural datasets: Sugarbeet and Corn-Weed, both containing three semantic classes: background, crop and weed. Our results indicated that active learning, especially PowerBALD, yields a higher performance than Random sampling on both datasets. But due to the relatively large standard deviations, the differences observed were minimal; this was partly caused by high image redundancy and imbalanced classes. Specifically, more than 89\% of the pixels belonged to the background class on both datasets. The absence of significant results on both datasets indicates that further research is required for applying active learning on agricultural datasets, especially if they contain a high-class imbalance and redundant images. Recommendations and insights are provided in this paper to potentially resolve such issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative weather for improved crop model simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00528v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and precise crop yield prediction is invaluable for decision making at both farm levels and regional levels. To make yield prediction, crop models are widely used for their capability to simulate hypothetical scenarios. While accuracy and precision of yield prediction critically depend on weather inputs to simulations, surprisingly little attention has been paid to preparing weather inputs. We propose a new method to construct generative models for long-term weather forecasts and ultimately improve crop yield prediction. We demonstrate use of the method in two representative scenarios -- single-year production of wheat, barley and canola and three-year production using rotations of these crops. Results show significant improvement from the conventional method, measured in terms of mean and standard deviation of prediction errors. Our method outperformed the conventional method in every one of 18 metrics for the first scenario and in 29 out of 36 metrics for the second scenario. For individual crop modellers to start applying the method to their problems, technical details are carefully explained, and all the code, trained PyTorch models, APSIM simulation files and result data are made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Region Transfer Learning for Segmentation of Crop Field Boundaries in Satellite Images with Limited Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00179v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of field boundary delineation is to predict the polygonal boundaries and interiors of individual crop fields in overhead remotely sensed images (e.g., from satellites or drones). Automatic delineation of field boundaries is a necessary task for many real-world use cases in agriculture, such as estimating cultivated area in a region or predicting end-of-season yield in a field. Field boundary delineation can be framed as an instance segmentation problem, but presents unique research challenges compared to traditional computer vision datasets used for instance segmentation. The practical applicability of previous work is also limited by the assumption that a sufficiently-large labeled dataset is available where field boundary delineation models will be applied, which is not the reality for most regions (especially under-resourced regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa). We present an approach for segmentation of crop field boundaries in satellite images in regions lacking labeled data that uses multi-region transfer learning to adapt model weights for the target region. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods and that multi-region transfer learning substantially boosts performance for multiple model architectures. Our implementation and datasets are publicly available to enable use of the approach by end-users and serve as a benchmark for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2023 AAAI Workshop on AI to Accelerate Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[The New Agronomists: Language Models are Experts in Crop Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19839v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop management plays a crucial role in determining crop yield, economic profitability, and environmental sustainability. Despite the availability of management guidelines, optimizing these practices remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. In response, previous studies have explored using reinforcement learning with crop simulators, typically employing simple neural-network-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Building on this foundation, this paper introduces a more advanced intelligent crop management system. This system uniquely combines RL, a language model (LM), and crop simulations facilitated by the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We utilize deep RL, specifically a deep Q-network, to train management policies that process numerous state variables from the simulator as observations. A novel aspect of our approach is the conversion of these state variables into more informative language, facilitating the language model's capacity to understand states and explore optimal management practices. The empirical results reveal that the LM exhibits superior learning capabilities. Through simulation experiments with maize crops in Florida (US) and Zaragoza (Spain), the LM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under various evaluation metrics but also demonstrates a remarkable improvement of over 49\% in economic profit, coupled with reduced environmental impact when compared to baseline methods.

| **[A Machine Learning Approach for Crop Yield and Disease Prediction Integrating Soil Nutrition and Weather Factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19273v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of an intelligent agricultural decision-supporting system for crop selection and disease forecasting in Bangladesh is the main objective of this work. The economy of the nation depends heavily on agriculture. However, choosing crops with better production rates and efficiently controlling crop disease are obstacles that farmers have to face. These issues are addressed in this research by utilizing machine learning methods and real-world datasets. The recommended approach uses a variety of datasets on the production of crops, soil conditions, agro-meteorological regions, crop disease, and meteorological factors. These datasets offer insightful information on disease trends, soil nutrition demand of crops, and agricultural production history. By incorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily selected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then the predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used to forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by utilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use of the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a final crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the outcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as prevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions. Consequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers can predict possible crop yields. Overall, by offering a detailed decision support system for crop selection and disease prediction, this work can play a vital role in advancing agricultural practices in Bangladesh.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented to the IEEE conference, "2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Electrical, and Smart Systems (iCACCESS), 8-9 March, Dhaka, Bangladesh"</p></details> |

In recent years it has been observed that significant information can be extrapolated from them about the lifecycle of the image, but no study has focused on the analysis between them and the source resolution of the image. In this work, we investigated a novel image resolution classifier that employs DCT statistics with the goal to detect the original resolution of images; in particular the insight was exploited to address the challenge of identifying cropped images. Training a Machine Learning (ML) classifier on entire images (not cropped), the generated model can leverage this information to detect cropping. The results demonstrate the classifier's reliability in distinguishing between cropped and not cropped images, providing a dependable estimation of their original resolution. This advancement has significant implications for image processing applications, including digital security, authenticity verification, and visual quality analysis, by offering a new tool for detecting image manipulations and enhancing qualitative image assessment. This work opens new perspectives in the field, with potential to transform image analysis and usage across multiple domains.}</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

Thus, this study implements 6 regression models (Linear, Tree, Gradient Descent, Gradient Boosting, K Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) to predict crop yields in 37 developing countries over 27 years. Given 4 key training parameters, insecticides (tonnes), rainfall (mm), temperature (Celsius), and yield (hg/ha), it was found that our Random Forest Regression model achieved a determination coefficient (r2) of 0.94, with a margin of error (ME) of .03. The models were trained and tested using the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations data, along with the World Bank Climate Change Data Catalog. Furthermore, each parameter was analyzed to understand how varying factors could impact overall yield. We used unconventional models, contrary to generally used Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) models, combined with recently collected data to implement a unique approach in our research. Existing scholarship would benefit from understanding the most optimal model for agricultural research, specifically using the United Nations data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, Guided by Dr. Aditya Undurti</p></details> |

Central to our methodology is the application of physics-guided inverse regression, a technique that significantly improves the model's ability to precisely predict quality metrics of crops. This approach directly addresses the challenges of scalability, speed, and practicality that traditional assessment methods face. By integrating physical principles, notably Fick`s second law of diffusion, into neural network architectures, our developed PGNN model achieves a notable advancement in enhancing both the interpretability and accuracy of assessments. Empirical validation conducted on cucumbers and mushrooms demonstrates the superior capability of our model in outperforming conventional computer vision techniques in postharvest quality evaluation. This underscores our contribution as a scalable and efficient solution to the pressing demands of global food supply challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoiseCollage: A Layout-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion Model Based on Noise Cropping and Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03485v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layout-aware text-to-image generation is a task to generate multi-object images that reflect layout conditions in addition to text conditions. The current layout-aware text-to-image diffusion models still have several issues, including mismatches between the text and layout conditions and quality degradation of generated images. This paper proposes a novel layout-aware text-to-image diffusion model called NoiseCollage to tackle these issues. During the denoising process, NoiseCollage independently estimates noises for individual objects and then crops and merges them into a single noise. This operation helps avoid condition mismatches; in other words, it can put the right objects in the right places. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that NoiseCollage outperforms several state-of-the-art models. These successful results indicate that the crop-and-merge operation of noises is a reasonable strategy to control image generation. We also show that NoiseCollage can be integrated with ControlNet to use edges, sketches, and pose skeletons as additional conditions. Experimental results show that this integration boosts the layout accuracy of ControlNet.

| **[An EnKF-LSTM Assimilation Algorithm for Crop Growth Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03406v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely prediction of crop growth is of great significance to ensure crop yields and researchers have developed several crop models for the prediction of crop growth. However, there are large difference between the simulation results obtained by the crop models and the actual results, thus in this paper, we proposed to combine the simulation results with the collected crop data for data assimilation so that the accuracy of prediction will be improved. In this paper, an EnKF-LSTM data assimilation method for various crops is proposed by combining ensemble Kalman filter and LSTM neural network, which effectively avoids the overfitting problem of existing data assimilation methods and eliminates the uncertainty of the measured data. The verification of the proposed EnKF-LSTM method and the comparison of the proposed method with other data assimilation methods were performed using datasets collected by sensor equipment deployed on a farm.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel strategy that performs segmentation using specialist networks that focus on a single anatomy (left ventricle, right ventricle, or myocardium). Given an input long-axis cardiac MR image, our method performs a ternary segmentation in the first stage to identify these anatomical regions, followed by cropping the original image to focus subsequent processing on the anatomical regions. The specialist networks are coupled through an attention mechanism that performs cross-attention to interlink features from different anatomies, serving as a soft relative shape prior. Central to our approach is an additive attention block (E-2A block), which is used throughout our architecture thanks to its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The proposed Context-Self Contrastive Loss (CSCL) learns an embedding space that makes semantic boundaries pop-up by use of a similarity metric between every location in a training sample and its local context. For crop type semantic segmentation from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) we find performance at parcel boundaries to be a critical bottleneck and explain how CSCL tackles the underlying cause of that problem, improving the state-of-the-art performance in this task. Additionally, using images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite missions we compile the largest, to our knowledge, SITS dataset densely annotated by crop type and parcel identities, which we make publicly available together with the data generation pipeline. Using that data we find CSCL, even with minimal pre-training, to improve all respective baselines and present a process for semantic segmentation at super-resolution for obtaining crop classes at a more granular level.

| **[Enhancing crop classification accuracy by synthetic SAR-Optical data generation using deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02121v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop classification using remote sensing data has emerged as a prominent research area in recent decades. Studies have demonstrated that fusing SAR and optical images can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification. However, a major challenge in this field is the limited availability of training data, which adversely affects the performance of classifiers. In agricultural regions, the dominant crops typically consist of one or two specific types, while other crops are scarce. Consequently, when collecting training samples to create a map of agricultural products, there is an abundance of samples from the dominant crops, forming the majority classes. Conversely, samples from other crops are scarce, representing the minority classes. Addressing this issue requires overcoming several challenges and weaknesses associated with traditional data generation methods. These methods have been employed to tackle the imbalanced nature of the training data. Nevertheless, they still face limitations in effectively handling the minority classes. Overall, the issue of inadequate training data, particularly for minority classes, remains a hurdle that traditional methods struggle to overcome. In this research, We explore the effectiveness of conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) as a synthetic data generation method based on a deep learning network, in addressing the challenge of limited training data for minority classes in crop classification using the fusion of SAR-optical data. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed method generates synthetic data with higher quality that can significantly increase the number of samples for minority classes leading to better performance of crop classifiers.</p></details> |  |

To date, however, crop type maps remain challenging to create in low and middle-income countries due to a lack of ground truth labels for training machine learning models. Field surveys are the gold standard in terms of accuracy but require an often-prohibitively large amount of time, money, and statistical capacity. In recent years, street-level imagery, such as Google Street View, KartaView, and Mapillary, has become available around the world. Such imagery contains rich information about crop types grown at particular locations and times. In this work, we develop an automated system to generate crop type ground references using deep learning and Google Street View imagery. The method efficiently curates a set of street view images containing crop fields, trains a model to predict crop type by utilizing weakly-labelled images from disparate out-of-domain sources, and combines predicted labels with remote sensing time series to create a wall-to-wall crop type map. We show that, in Thailand, the resulting country-wide map of rice, cassava, maize, and sugarcane achieves an accuracy of 93%. We publicly release the first-ever crop type map for all of Thailand 2022 at 10m-resolution with no gaps. To our knowledge, this is the first time a 10m-resolution, multi-crop map has been created for any smallholder country. As the availability of roadside imagery expands, our pipeline provides a way to map crop types at scale around the globe, especially in underserved smallholder regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI-24: Special Track on AI for Social Impact</p></details> |

Over the years, many successful machine learning models for crop mapping have been developed that use just the multi-spectral imagery from satellites to predict crop type over the area of interest. However, these traditional methods do not account for the physical processes that govern crop growth. At a high level, crop growth can be envisioned as physical parameters, such as weather and soil type, acting upon the plant leading to crop growth which can be observed via satellites. In this paper, we propose Weather-based Spatio-Temporal segmentation network with ATTention (WSTATT), a deep learning model that leverages this understanding of crop growth by formulating it as an inverse model that combines weather (Daymet) and satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) to generate accurate crop maps. We show that our approach provides significant improvements over existing algorithms that solely rely on spectral imagery by comparing segmentation maps and F1 classification scores. Furthermore, effective use of attention in WSTATT architecture enables detection of crop types earlier in the season (up to 5 months in advance), which is very useful for improving food supply projections. We finally discuss the impact of weather by correlating our results with crop phenology to show that WSTATT is able to capture physical properties of crop growth.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM24)</p></details> |

We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate three novel approaches to enhance RT-DETR robustness in foggy environments: (1) Domain Adaptation via Perceptual Loss, which distills domain-invariant features from a teacher network to a student using perceptual supervision; (2) Weather Adaptive Attention, which augments the attention mechanism with fog-sensitive scaling by introducing an auxiliary foggy image stream; and (3) Weather Fusion Encoder, which integrates a dual-stream encoder architecture that fuses clear and foggy image features via multi-head self and cross-attention. Despite the architectural innovations, none of the proposed methods consistently outperform the baseline RT-DETR. We analyze the limitations and potential causes, offering insights for future research in weather-aware object detection.</p></details> |  |

However, subseasonal forecasting is a complex task in meteorology due to dissipating initial conditions and delayed external forces. Although AI models are increasingly pushing the boundaries of this forecasting limit, they face two major challenges: error accumulation and Smoothness. To address these two challenges, we propose Climate Furnace Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (TianQuan-Climate), a novel machine learning model designed to provide global daily mean forecasts up to 45 days, covering five upper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and two surface variables. Our proposed TianQuan-Climate has two advantages: 1) it utilizes a multi-model prediction strategy to reduce system error impacts in long-term subseasonal forecasts; 2) it incorporates a Content Fusion Module for climatological integration and extends ViT with uncertainty blocks (UD-ViT) to improve generalization by learning from uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TianQuan-Climate on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections within the 15 to 45-day range, where TianQuan-Climate outperforms existing numerical and AI methods.</p></details> |  |

Apart from global forecasting there is also a large value in high-resolution regional weather forecasts, focusing on accurate simulations of the atmosphere for a limited area. Initial attempts have been made to use machine learning for such limited area scenarios, but these experiments do not consider realistic forecasting settings and do not investigate the many design choices involved. We present a framework for building kilometer-scale machine learning limited area models with boundary conditions imposed through a flexible boundary forcing method. This enables boundary conditions defined either from reanalysis or operational forecast data. Our approach employs specialized graph constructions with rectangular and triangular meshes, along with multi-step rollout training strategies to improve temporal consistency. We perform systematic evaluation of different design choices, including the boundary width, graph construction and boundary forcing integration. Models are evaluated across both a Danish and a Swiss domain, two regions that exhibit different orographical characteristics. Verification is performed against both gridded analysis data and in-situ observations, including a case study for the storm Ciara in February 2020. Both models achieve skillful predictions across a wide range of variables, with our Swiss model outperforming the numerical weather prediction baseline for key surface variables. With their substantially lower computational cost, our findings demonstrate great potential for machine learning limited area models in the future of regional weather forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 50 figures.

While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 17 figures.

However, existing unsupervised methods for maritime object classification often struggle with the long-tail data distributions in both object categories and weather conditions. In this paper, we construct a dataset named AIMO produced by large-scale generative models with diverse weather conditions and balanced object categories, and collect a dataset named RMO with real-world images where long-tail issue exists. We propose a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages AIMO (source domain) to address the problem of limited labeled data, unbalanced distribution and domain shift in RMO (target domain), enhance the generalization of source features with the Vision-Language Models such as CLIP, and propose a difficulty score for curriculum learning to optimize training process. Experimental results shows that the proposed method significantly improves the classification accuracy, particularly for samples within rare object categories and weather conditions.

Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</p></details> |  |

| **[Deep Learning Meets Teleconnections: Improving S2S Predictions for European Winter Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07625v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictions on subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales--ranging from two weeks to two month--are crucial for early warning systems but remain challenging owing to chaos in the climate system. Teleconnections, such as the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), offer windows of enhanced predictability, however, their complex interactions remain underutilized in operational forecasting. Here, we developed and evaluated deep learning architectures to predict North Atlantic-European (NAE) weather regimes, systematically assessing the role of remote drivers in improving S2S forecast skill of deep learning models. We implemented (1) a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network predicting the NAE regimes of the next six weeks based on previous regimes, (2) an Index-LSTM incorporating SPV and MJO indices, and (3) a ViT-LSTM using a Vision Transformer to directly encode stratospheric wind and tropical outgoing longwave radiation fields. These models are compared with operational hindcasts as well as other AI models. Our results show that leveraging teleconnection information enhances skill at longer lead times. Notably, the ViT-LSTM outperforms ECMWF's subseasonal hindcasts beyond week 4 by improving Scandinavian Blocking (SB) and Atlantic Ridge (AR) predictions. Analysis of high-confidence predictions reveals that NAO-, SB, and AR opportunity forecasts can be associated with SPV variability and MJO phase patterns aligning with established pathways, also indicating new patterns. Overall, our work demonstrates that encoding physically meaningful climate fields can enhance S2S prediction skill, advancing AI-driven subseasonal forecast. Moreover, the experiments highlight the potential of deep learning methods as investigative tools, providing new insights into atmospheric dynamics and predictability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather and Demand Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by variable renewable energy technologies. However, renewable electricity generation from wind and solar technologies, as well as electricity demand, varies with the weather. This work addresses the problem of determining optimal capacities for renewable technologies in energy systems that ensure sufficient electricity supply when dealing with multi-year time-series data. An iterative algorithm is proposed that starts by optimising an arbitrary starting time-series, followed by adding additional constraints and reoptimising the modified optimisation problem until sufficient energy supply is provided for all time--series, i.e. the solution is robust to weather and demand variations. This is evaluated in a computational study on a German energy system model.The results show that the iterative algorithm finds robust solutions for an increase of 2-2.5% in total annual cost for a simplified model in gurobipy and 2.9% for a model built in the model framework ETHOS.FINE. Testing the feasibility for non robust solutions showed that supply gaps occurred in at least some of the remaining years. Based on the results of this work, ensuring feasibility within an energy system model for multiple time-series boils down to two factors: ensuring sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of high demand combined with low electricity generation from wind and photovoltaic, and enforcing sufficient total annual electricity generation. Our proposed open source iterative algorithm is able to ensure this. For general modelling, it is recommended to check for systematic effects of different years' time--series on energy system models especially for wind, but also for photovoltaics, include dark lull and cold period effects on generation and demand in time--series, and assess the feasibility of energy system models using different time-series.</p></details> |  |

Animating Static Gaussian Scenes With Dynamic Weather Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05296v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that interact naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we present a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle representations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and physical realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://galfiebelman.github.io/let-it-snow/</p></details> |

This study introduces a 3-D Gaussian Mixture Model to predict long lead-time flight trajectory changes, incorporating comprehensive weather and traffic data. Utilizing high-resolution meteorological datasets, including convective weather maps and wind data, alongside traffic records, the model demonstrates robust performance in forecasting reroutes up to 60 minutes. The novel 3-D Gaussian Mixture Model framework employs a probabilistic approach to capture uncertainty while providing accurate forecasts of altitude, latitude, and longitude. Extensive evaluation revealed a Mean Absolute Percentage Error below 0.02 across varying lead times, highlighting the model's accuracy and scalability. By integrating explainability techniques such as the Vanilla Gradient algorithm, the study provides insights into feature contributions, showing that they contribute to improving Air Traffic Management strategies to mitigate weather-induced disruptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DA2Diff: Exploring Degradation-aware Adaptive Diffusion Priors for All-in-One Weather Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05135v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration under adverse weather conditions is a critical task for many vision-based applications. Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle multiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential. However, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather conditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world degradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with degradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed DA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive degradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration. Specifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware representations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space. By aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each prompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The learned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed weather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple weather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather degradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a dynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of restoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion model to restore diverse degradations adaptively. Experimental results substantiate the favorable performance of DA2Diff over state-of-the-arts in quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Source code will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReviveDiff: A Universal Diffusion Model for Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18932v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured in challenging environments--such as nighttime, smoke, rainy weather, and underwater--often suffer from significant degradation, resulting in a substantial loss of visual quality. The effective restoration of these degraded images is critical for the subsequent vision tasks. While many existing approaches have successfully incorporated specific priors for individual tasks, these tailored solutions limit their applicability to other degradations. In this work, we propose a universal network architecture, dubbed ``ReviveDiff'', which can address various degradations and bring images back to life by enhancing and restoring their quality. Our approach is inspired by the observation that, unlike degradation caused by movement or electronic issues, quality degradation under adverse conditions primarily stems from natural media (such as fog, water, and low luminance), which generally preserves the original structures of objects. To restore the quality of such images, we leveraged the latest advancements in diffusion models and developed ReviveDiff to restore image quality from both macro and micro levels across some key factors determining image quality, such as sharpness, distortion, noise level, dynamic range, and color accuracy. We rigorously evaluated ReviveDiff on seven benchmark datasets covering five types of degrading conditions: Rainy, Underwater, Low-light, Smoke, and Nighttime Hazy. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReviveDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.</p></details> |  |
| **[Huge Ensembles Part I: Design of Ensemble Weather Forecasts using Spherical Fourier Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03100v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying low-likelihood high-impact extreme weather events in a warming world is a significant and challenging task for current ensemble forecasting systems. While these systems presently use up to 100 members, larger ensembles could enrich the sampling of internal variability. They may capture the long tails associated with climate hazards better than traditional ensemble sizes. Due to computational constraints, it is infeasible to generate huge ensembles (comprised of 1,000-10,000 members) with traditional, physics-based numerical models. In this two-part paper, we replace traditional numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) to generate hindcasts of huge ensembles. In Part I, we construct an ensemble weather forecasting system based on Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), and we discuss important design decisions for constructing such an ensemble. The ensemble represents model uncertainty through perturbed-parameter techniques, and it represents initial condition uncertainty through bred vectors, which sample the fastest growing modes of the forecast. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) as a baseline, we develop an evaluation pipeline composed of mean, spectral, and extreme diagnostics. Using large-scale, distributed SFNOs with 1.1 billion learned parameters, we achieve calibrated probabilistic forecasts. As the trajectories of the individual members diverge, the ML ensemble mean spectra degrade with lead time, consistent with physical expectations. However, the individual ensemble members' spectra stay constant with lead time. Therefore, these members simulate realistic weather states, and the ML ensemble thus passes a crucial spectral test in the literature. The IFS and ML ensembles have similar Extreme Forecast Indices, and we show that the ML extreme weather forecasts are reliable and discriminating.</p></details> |  |
| **[Example-Based Concept Analysis Framework for Deep Weather Forecast Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00831v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the trustworthiness of an AI model, finding consistent, understandable representations of its inference process is essential. This understanding is particularly important in high-stakes operations such as weather forecasting, where the identification of underlying meteorological mechanisms is as critical as the accuracy of the predictions. Despite the growing literature that addresses this issue through explainable AI, the applicability of their solutions is often limited due to their AI-centric development. To fill this gap, we follow a user-centric process to develop an example-based concept analysis framework, which identifies cases that follow a similar inference process as the target instance in a target model and presents them in a user-comprehensible format. Our framework provides the users with visually and conceptually analogous examples, including the probability of concept assignment to resolve ambiguities in weather mechanisms. To bridge the gap between vector representations identified from models and human-understandable explanations, we compile a human-annotated concept dataset and implement a user interface to assist domain experts involved in the the framework development.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Generative Data Assimilation of Sparse Weather Station Observations at Kilometer Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16947v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation of observational data into full atmospheric states is essential for weather forecast model initialization. Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Neural Weather Models (NWMs) offer a computationally inexpensive and fast approach for forecasting atmospheric environments on a 0.25{\deg} global grid. For thunderstorms, these environments can be empirically post-processed to predict wind gust distributions at specific locations. With the Pangu-Weather NWM, we apply a hierarchy of statistical and deep learning post-processing methods to forecast hourly wind gusts up to three days ahead. To ensure statistical robustness, we constrain our probabilistic forecasts using generalised extreme-value distributions across five regions in Switzerland. Using a convolutional neural network to post-process the predicted atmospheric environment's spatial patterns yields the best results, outperforming direct forecasting approaches across lead times and wind gust speeds. Our results confirm the added value of NWMs for extreme wind forecasting, especially for designing more responsive early-warning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, submitted to npj Natural Hazards</p></details> |

Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization.

Our approach combines Bayesian Structural Time Series for modeling marginal crop yields, ensuring a more robust quantification of uncertainty given the typically short historical records. To capture dynamic dependencies between regions, we develop a time-varying conditional copula model, where the copula parameter evolves over time as a function of its previous lag and extreme weather covariates. Unlike traditional approaches that treat climatic factors as fixed inputs, we incorporate dynamic Generalized Extreme Value models to characterize extreme weather events, enabling a more accurate reflection of their impact on crop yields. Furthermore, to ensure scalability for large-scale applications, we build on the existing Partitioning Around Medoids clustering algorithm and introduce a novel dissimilarity measure that integrates both spatial and copula-based dependence, enabling an effective reduction of the dimensionality in the dependence structure.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the following advances: 1) a latent rollout that enables arbitrary-length predictions in latent space without intermediate encoding or decoding; and 2) a modular architecture that flexibly utilizes mixed-horizon processors and encodes multiple real-time analyses to create blended initial conditions. WM-3 generates 14-day global forecasts at 0.25-degree resolution in 12 seconds on a single RTX 4090. This represents a >100,000-fold speedup over traditional NWP approaches while achieving superior accuracy with up to 37.7% improvement in RMSE over operational models, requiring only a single consumer-grade GPU for deployment.

In particular, diffusion models represent fine-scale details without spatial smoothing, which is crucial for mesoscale predictions, such as heavy rainfall forecasting. However, the applications of diffusion models to mesoscale prediction remain limited. To address this gap, this study proposes an architecture that combines a diffusion model with Swin-Unet as a deterministic model, achieving mesoscale predictions while maintaining flexibility. The proposed architecture trains the two models independently, allowing the diffusion model to remain unchanged when the deterministic model is updated. Comparisons using the Fractions Skill Score and power spectral analysis demonstrate that incorporating the diffusion model leads to improved accuracy compared to predictions without it. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed architecture to enhance mesoscale predictions, particularly for strong rainfall events, while maintaining flexibility.</p></details> |  |

In typical driving scenes, "things" categories can be dynamic and associated with higher collision risks, making them crucial for safe navigation and planning. Recognizing the importance of "things" categories, we identify their performance drop as a serious bottleneck in existing approaches. We observed that adverse weather induces degradation of semantic-level features and both corruption of local features, leading to a misprediction of "things" as "stuff". To mitigate these corruptions, we suggest our method, NTN - segmeNt Things for No-accident. To address semantic-level feature corruption, we bind each point feature to its superclass, preventing the misprediction of things classes into visually dissimilar categories. Additionally, to enhance robustness against local corruption caused by adverse weather, we define each LiDAR beam as a local region and propose a regularization term that aligns the clean data with its corrupted counterpart in feature space. NTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a +2.6 mIoU gain on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark and +7.9 mIoU on the SemanticPOSS-to-SemanticSTF benchmark. Notably, NTN achieves a +4.8 and +7.9 mIoU improvement on "things" classes, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Even though Collaborative Perception (CP) improves AV perception in difficult conditions, existing CP datasets lack adverse weather conditions. To address this, we introduce Adver-City, the first open-source synthetic CP dataset focused on adverse weather conditions. Simulated in CARLA with OpenCDA, it contains over 24 thousand frames, over 890 thousand annotations, and 110 unique scenarios across six different weather conditions: clear weather, soft rain, heavy rain, fog, foggy heavy rain and, for the first time in a synthetic CP dataset, glare. It has six object categories including pedestrians and cyclists, and uses data from vehicles and roadside units featuring LiDARs, RGB and semantic segmentation cameras, GNSS, and IMUs. Its scenarios, based on real crash reports, depict the most relevant road configurations for adverse weather and poor visibility conditions, varying in object density, with both dense and sparse scenes, allowing for novel testing conditions of CP models. Benchmarks run on the dataset show that weather conditions created challenging conditions for perception models, with CoBEVT scoring 58.30/52.44/38.90 (AP@30/50/70).

While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the domain gap. In this paper, we propose a Domain Generalization based approach, named \textit{V2X-DGW}, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Our research aims to not only maintain favorable multi-agent performance in the clean weather but also promote the performance in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To realize the Domain Generalization, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA).

While state-of-the-art (SOTA) LPR methods perform well in clean weather, they still struggle with weather-induced corruption commonly encountered in driving scenarios. To tackle this, we propose ResLPRNet, a novel LiDAR data restoration network that largely enhances LPR performance under adverse weather by restoring corrupted LiDAR scans using a wavelet transform-based network. ResLPRNet is efficient, lightweight and can be integrated plug-and-play with pretrained LPR models without substantial additional computational cost. Given the lack of LPR datasets under adverse weather, we introduce ResLPR, a novel benchmark that examines SOTA LPR methods under a wide range of LiDAR distortions induced by severe snow, fog, and rain conditions. Experiments on our proposed WeatherKITTI and WeatherNCLT datasets demonstrate the resilience and notable gains achieved by using our restoration method with multiple LPR approaches in challenging weather scenarios.

Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

These environmental factors impair the performance of cameras, LiDAR, and radar, leading to reduced situational awareness and increased accident risks. Conventional cloud-based AI systems introduce communication delays, making them unsuitable for the rapid decision-making required in real-time autonomous navigation. This paper presents a novel Edge AI-driven real-time decision-making framework designed to enhance AV responsiveness under adverse weather conditions. The proposed approach integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for improved perception, alongside reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies to optimize vehicle control in uncertain environments. By processing data at the network edge, this system significantly reduces decision latency while improving AV adaptability. The framework is evaluated using simulated driving scenarios in CARLA and real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, covering diverse weather conditions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves a 40% reduction in processing time and a 25% enhancement in perception accuracy compared to conventional cloud-based systems. These findings highlight the potential of Edge AI in improving AV autonomy, safety, and efficiency, paving the way for more reliable self-driving technology in challenging real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Weather Data from Pixel to Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06623v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing impact of climate change and extreme weather events has spurred growing interest in deep learning for weather research. However, existing studies often rely on weather data in pixel space, which presents several challenges such as smooth outputs in model outputs, limited applicability to a single pressure-variable subset (PVS), and high data storage and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Weather Latent Autoencoder (WLA) that transforms weather data from pixel space to latent space, enabling efficient weather task modeling. By decoupling weather reconstruction from downstream tasks, WLA improves the accuracy and sharpness of weather task model results. The incorporated Pressure-Variable Unified Module transforms multiple PVS into a unified representation, enhancing the adaptability of the model in multiple weather scenarios. Furthermore, weather tasks can be performed in a low-storage latent space of WLA rather than a high-storage pixel space, thus significantly reducing data storage and computational costs. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate its superior compression and reconstruction performance, enabling the creation of the ERA5-latent dataset with unified representations of multiple PVS from ERA5 data. The compressed full PVS in the ERA5-latent dataset reduces the original 244.34 TB of data to 0.43 TB. The downstream task further demonstrates that task models can apply to multiple PVS with low data costs in latent space and achieve superior performance compared to models in pixel space. Code, ERA5-latent data, and pre-trained models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Weather-Latent-Autoencoder-8467.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Energy-Efficient Satellite IoT Optical Downlinks Using Weather-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11198v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become increasingly ubiquitous with applications not only in urban areas but remote areas as well. These devices support industries such as agriculture, forestry, and resource extraction. Due to the device location being in remote areas, satellites are frequently used to collect and deliver IoT device data to customers. As these devices become increasingly advanced and numerous, the amount of data produced has rapidly increased potentially straining the ability for radio frequency (RF) downlink capacity. Free space optical communications with their wide available bandwidths and high data rates are a potential solution, but these communication systems are highly vulnerable to weather-related disruptions. This results in certain communication opportunities being inefficient in terms of the amount of data received versus the power expended. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method using Deep Q-Networks that takes advantage of weather condition forecasts to improve energy efficiency while delivering the same number of packets as schemes that don't factor weather into routing decisions. We compare this method with simple approaches that utilize simple cloud cover thresholds to improve energy efficiency. In testing the DRL approach provides improved median energy efficiency without a significant reduction in median delivery ratio. Simple cloud cover thresholds were also found to be effective but the thresholds with the highest energy efficiency had reduced median delivery ratio values.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Removing Multiple Hybrid Adverse Weather in Video via a Unified Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06200v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos captured under real-world adverse weather conditions typically suffer from uncertain hybrid weather artifacts with heterogeneous degradation distributions. However, existing algorithms only excel at specific single degradation distributions due to limited adaption capacity and have to deal with different weather degradations with separately trained models, thus may fail to handle real-world stochastic weather scenarios. Besides, the model training is also infeasible due to the lack of paired video data to characterize the coexistence of multiple weather. To ameliorate the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel unified model, dubbed UniWRV, to remove multiple heterogeneous video weather degradations in an all-in-one fashion. Specifically, to tackle degenerate spatial feature heterogeneity, we propose a tailored weather prior guided module that queries exclusive priors for different instances as prompts to steer spatial feature characterization. To tackle degenerate temporal feature heterogeneity, we propose a dynamic routing aggregation module that can automatically select optimal fusion paths for different instances to dynamically integrate temporal features. Additionally, we managed to construct a new synthetic video dataset, termed HWVideo, for learning and benchmarking multiple hybrid adverse weather removal, which contains 15 hybrid weather conditions with a total of 1500 adverse-weather/clean paired video clips. Real-world hybrid weather videos are also collected for evaluating model generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our UniWRV exhibits robust and superior adaptation capability in multiple heterogeneous degradations learning scenarios, including various generic video restoration tasks beyond weather removal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative assimilation and prediction for weather and climate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03038v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have shown great success in predicting weather up to two weeks ahead, outperforming process-based benchmarks. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the prediction task, and do not incorporate the necessary data assimilation. Moreover, these models suffer from error accumulation in long roll-outs, limiting their applicability to seasonal predictions or climate projections. Here, we introduce Generative Assimilation and Prediction (GAP), a unified deep generative framework for assimilation and prediction of both weather and climate. By learning to quantify the probabilistic distribution of atmospheric states under observational, predictive, and external forcing constraints, GAP excels in a broad range of weather-climate related tasks, including data assimilation, seamless prediction, and climate simulation. In particular, GAP is competitive with state-of-the-art ensemble assimilation, probabilistic weather forecast and seasonal prediction, yields stable millennial simulations, and reproduces climate variability from daily to decadal time scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-Enhanced Desnowing: A Novel Single Image Restoration Approach for Traffic Surveillance under Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01339v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration under adverse weather conditions refers to the process of removing degradation caused by weather particles while improving visual quality. Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Weather Station Data and Radar for Precipitation Nowcasting: SmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16116v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, data-driven, deep learning-based approaches for precipitation nowcasting have attracted significant attention, showing promising results. However, many existing models fail to fully exploit the extensive atmospheric information available, relying primarily on precipitation data alone. This study introduces two novel deep learning architectures, SmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet, specifically designed to enhance precipitation nowcasting by integrating multi-variable weather station data with radar datasets. By leveraging additional meteorological information, these models improve representation learning in the latent space, resulting in enhanced nowcasting performance. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet framework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer, integrating it into the bottleneck of the network. Conversely, the SmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data processed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate variable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder architecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration. Experimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of weather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which relies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios, while SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation scenarios. This highlights the potential of incorporating discrete weather station data to enhance the performance of deep learning-based weather nowcasting models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06104v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effectiveness of Neural Operators at Zero-Shot Weather Downscaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13955v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) methods have shown great potential for weather downscaling. These data-driven approaches provide a more efficient alternative for producing high-resolution weather datasets and forecasts compared to physics-based numerical simulations. Neural operators, which learn solution operators for a family of partial differential equations (PDEs), have shown great success in scientific ML applications involving physics-driven datasets. Neural operators are grid-resolution-invariant and are often evaluated on higher grid resolutions than they are trained on, i.e., zero-shot super-resolution. Given their promising zero-shot super-resolution performance on dynamical systems emulation, we present a critical investigation of their zero-shot weather downscaling capabilities, which is when models are tasked with producing high-resolution outputs using higher upsampling factors than are seen during training. To this end, we create two realistic downscaling experiments with challenging upsampling factors (e.g., 8x and 15x) across data from different simulations: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) and the Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK). While neural operator-based downscaling models perform better than interpolation and a simple convolutional baseline, we show the surprising performance of an approach that combines a powerful transformer-based model with parameter-free interpolation at zero-shot weather downscaling. We find that this Swin-Transformer-based approach mostly outperforms models with neural operator layers in terms of average error metrics, whereas an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN)-based approach is better than most models in terms of capturing the physics of the ground truth data. We suggest their use in future work as strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[HR-Extreme: A High-Resolution Dataset for Extreme Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18885v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of large deep learning models in weather forecasting has led to significant advancements in the field, including higher-resolution forecasting and extended prediction periods exemplified by models such as Pangu and Fuxi. Despite these successes, previous research has largely been characterized by the neglect of extreme weather events, and the availability of datasets specifically curated for such events remains limited. Given the critical importance of accurately forecasting extreme weather, this study introduces a comprehensive dataset that incorporates high-resolution extreme weather cases derived from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) data, a 3-km real-time dataset provided by NOAA. We also evaluate the current state-of-the-art deep learning models and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems on HR-Extreme, and provide a improved baseline deep learning model called HR-Heim which has superior performance on both general loss and HR-Extreme compared to others. Our results reveal that the errors of extreme weather cases are significantly larger than overall forecast error, highlighting them as an crucial source of loss in weather prediction. These findings underscore the necessity for future research to focus on improving the accuracy of extreme weather forecasts to enhance their practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025.

| **[High-Dynamic Radar Sequence Prediction for Weather Nowcasting Using Spatiotemporal Coherent Gaussian Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14895v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning. Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral paper at ICLR 2025.

| **[Feature Engineering Approach to Building Load Prediction: A Case Study for Commercial Building Chiller Plant Optimization in Tropical Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15780v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tropical countries with high humidity, air conditioning can account for up to 60% of a building's energy use. For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLLMate: A Multimodal Benchmark for Weather and Climate Events Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19058v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting weather and climate events is crucial for making appropriate measures to mitigate environmental hazards and minimize losses. However, existing environmental forecasting research focuses narrowly on predicting numerical meteorological variables (e.g., temperature), neglecting the translation of these variables into actionable textual narratives of events and their consequences. To bridge this gap, we proposed Weather and Climate Event Forecasting (WCEF), a new task that leverages numerical meteorological raster data and textual event data to predict weather and climate events. This task is challenging to accomplish due to difficulties in aligning multimodal data and the lack of supervised datasets. To address these challenges, we present CLLMate, the first multimodal dataset for WCEF, using 26,156 environmental news articles aligned with ERA5 reanalysis data. We systematically benchmark 23 existing MLLMs on CLLMate, including closed-source, open-source, and our fine-tuned models. Our experiments reveal the advantages and limitations of existing MLLMs and the value of CLLMate for the training and benchmarking of the WCEF task.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClimateLLM: Efficient Weather Forecasting via Frequency-Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11059v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather forecasting is crucial for public safety, disaster prevention and mitigation, agricultural production, and energy management, with global relevance. Although deep learning has significantly advanced weather prediction, current methods face critical limitations: (i) they often struggle to capture both dynamic temporal dependencies and short-term abrupt changes, making extreme weather modeling difficult; (ii) they incur high computational costs due to extensive training and resource requirements; (iii) they have limited adaptability to multi-scale frequencies, leading to challenges when separating global trends from local fluctuations. To address these issues, we propose ClimateLLM, a foundation model for weather forecasting. It captures spatiotemporal dependencies via a cross-temporal and cross-spatial collaborative modeling framework that integrates Fourier-based frequency decomposition with Large Language Models (LLMs) to strengthen spatial and temporal modeling. Our framework uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism that adaptively processes different frequency components, enabling efficient handling of both global signals and localized extreme events. In addition, we introduce a cross-temporal and cross-spatial dynamic prompting mechanism, allowing LLMs to incorporate meteorological patterns across multiple scales effectively. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ClimateLLM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency, as a scalable solution for global weather forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, they suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions due to the quality deterioration of LiDAR point clouds. Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is expected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is challenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the degree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce L4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves LiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and Foreground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is the first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and 4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 ) parallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion (MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under adverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with simulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather conditions. It delivers a significant performance increase under different fog levels, improving the 3D mAP by up to 20.0% over the traditional LiDAR-only approach. Moreover, the results on the K-Radar dataset validate the consistent performance improvement of L4DR in real-world adverse weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI2025(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[CoDiCast: Conditional Diffusion Model for Global Weather Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05975v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 6-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[USRNet: Unified Scene Recovery Network for Enhancing Traffic Imaging under Multiple Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07372v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in computer vision technology have facilitated the extensive deployment of intelligent transportation systems and visual surveillance systems across various applications, including autonomous driving, public safety, and environmental monitoring. However, adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly degrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM), an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios. The code resources for this work can be accessed in https://github.com/LouisYxLu/USRNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regional Weather Variable Predictions by Machine Learning with Near-Surface Observational and Atmospheric Numerical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10450v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely regional weather prediction is vital for sectors dependent on weather-related decisions. Traditional prediction methods, based on atmospheric equations, often struggle with coarse temporal resolutions and inaccuracies. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) model, called MiMa (short for Micro-Macro), that integrates both near-surface observational data from Kentucky Mesonet stations (collected every five minutes, known as Micro data) and hourly atmospheric numerical outputs (termed as Macro data) for fine-resolution weather forecasting. The MiMa model employs an encoder-decoder transformer structure, with two encoders for processing multivariate data from both datasets and a decoder for forecasting weather variables over short time horizons. Each instance of the MiMa model, called a modelet, predicts the values of a specific weather parameter at an individual Mesonet station. The approach is extended with Re-MiMa modelets, which are designed to predict weather variables at ungauged locations by training on multivariate data from a few representative stations in a region, tagged with their elevations. Re-MiMa (short for Regional-MiMa) can provide highly accurate predictions across an entire region, even in areas without observational stations. Experimental results show that MiMa significantly outperforms current models, with Re-MiMa offering precise short-term forecasts for ungauged locations, marking a significant advancement in weather forecasting accuracy and applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, and water resource management. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning methods have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs). By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive information propagation mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions (e.g., typhoons), significantly improving forecast accuracy.

| **[Fixing the Double Penalty in Data-Driven Weather Forecasting Through a Modified Spherical Harmonic Loss Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19374v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in data-driven weather forecasting models have delivered deterministic models that outperform the leading operational forecast systems based on traditional, physics-based models. However, these data-driven models are typically trained with a mean squared error loss function, which causes smoothing of fine scales through a "double penalty" effect. We develop a simple, parameter-free modification to this loss function that avoids this problem by separating the loss attributable to decorrelation from the loss attributable to spectral amplitude errors. Fine-tuning the GraphCast model with this new loss function results in sharp deterministic weather forecasts, an increase of the model's effective resolution from 1,250km to 160km, improvements to ensemble spread, and improvements to predictions of tropical cyclone strength and surface wind extremes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validating Deep Learning Weather Forecast Models on Recent High-Impact Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17652v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecast accuracy of machine learning (ML) weather prediction models is improving rapidly, leading many to speak of a "second revolution in weather forecasting". With numerous methods being developed and limited physical guarantees offered by ML models, there is a critical need for a comprehensive evaluation of these emerging techniques. While this need has been partly fulfilled by benchmark datasets, they provide little information on rare and impactful extreme events or on compound impact metrics, for which model accuracy might degrade due to misrepresented dependencies between variables. To address these issues, we compare ML weather prediction models (GraphCast, PanguWeather, and FourCastNet) and ECMWF's high-resolution forecast system (HRES) in three case studies: the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, the 2023 South Asian humid heatwave, and the North American winter storm in 2021. We find that ML weather prediction models locally achieve similar accuracy to HRES on the record-shattering Pacific Northwest heatwave but underperform when aggregated over space and time. However, they forecast the compound winter storm substantially better. We also highlight structural differences in how the errors of HRES and the ML models build up to that event. The ML forecasts lack important variables for a detailed assessment of the health risks of the 2023 humid heatwave. Using a possible substitute variable, prediction errors show spatial patterns with the highest danger levels over Bangladesh being underestimated by the ML models. Generally, case-study-driven, impact-centric evaluation can complement existing research, increase public trust, and aid in developing reliable ML weather prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Multi-type emergency decisions within energy-transportation infrastructures significantly influence system performance throughout the extreme weather process. A comprehensive assessment of these factors faces challenges in model complexity and heterogeneity between energy and transportation systems. This paper proposes an assessment framework that accommodates multiple types of emergency decisions. It integrates the heterogeneous energy and transportation infrastructures in the form of a network flow model to simulate and quantify the impact of extreme weather events on the energy-transportation infrastructure system. Based on this framework, a targeted method for identifying system vulnerabilities is further introduced, utilizing a neural network surrogate that achieves privacy protection and evaluation acceleration while maintaining consideration of system interdependencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework and method can reveal the risk levels faced by urban infrastructure systems, identify weak points that should be prioritized for reinforcement, and strike a balance between accuracy and evaluation speed.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress existing models have made in the overall accuracy of the GSWF, executing high-precision extreme event prediction still presents a substantial challenge. The recent emergence of state-space models, with their ability to efficiently capture continuous-time dynamics and latent states, offer potential solutions. However, early investigations indicated that Mamba underperforms in the context of GSWF, suggesting further adaptation and optimization. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce Weather State-space Model (WSSM), a novel Mamba-based approach tailored for GSWF. Geographical knowledge is integrated in addition to the widely-used positional encoding to represent the absolute special-temporal position. The multi-scale time-frequency features are synthesized from coarse to fine to model the seasonal to extreme weather dynamic. Our method effectively improves the overall prediction accuracy and addresses the challenge of forecasting extreme weather events. The state-of-the-art results obtained on the Weather-5K subset underscore the efficacy of the WSSM</p></details> |  |

| **[DIDLM: A SLAM Dataset for Difficult Scenarios Featuring Infrared, Depth Cameras, LIDAR, 4D Radar, and Others under Adverse Weather, Low Light Conditions, and Rough Roads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09622v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather conditions, low-light environments, and bumpy road surfaces pose significant challenges to SLAM in robotic navigation and autonomous driving. Existing datasets in this field predominantly rely on single sensors or combinations of LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs. However, 4D millimeter-wave radar demonstrates robustness in adverse weather, infrared cameras excel in capturing details under low-light conditions, and depth images provide richer spatial information. Multi-sensor fusion methods also show potential for better adaptation to bumpy roads. Despite some SLAM studies incorporating these sensors and conditions, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets addressing low-light environments and bumpy road conditions, or featuring a sufficiently diverse range of sensor data. In this study, we introduce a multi-sensor dataset covering challenging scenarios such as snowy weather, rainy weather, nighttime conditions, speed bumps, and rough terrains. The dataset includes rarely utilized sensors for extreme conditions, such as 4D millimeter-wave radar, infrared cameras, and depth cameras, alongside 3D LiDAR, RGB cameras, GPS, and IMU. It supports both autonomous driving and ground robot applications and provides reliable GPS/INS ground truth data, covering structured and semi-structured terrains. We evaluated various SLAM algorithms using this dataset, including RGB images, infrared images, depth images, LiDAR, and 4D millimeter-wave radar. The dataset spans a total of 18.5 km, 69 minutes, and approximately 660 GB, offering a valuable resource for advancing SLAM research under complex and extreme conditions.

| **[Robust Single Object Tracking in LiDAR Point Clouds under Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07133v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D single object tracking (3DSOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task for outdoor perception, enabling real-time perception of object location, orientation, and motion. Despite the impressive performance of current 3DSOT methods, evaluating them on clean datasets inadequately reflects their comprehensive performance, as the adverse weather conditions in real-world surroundings has not been considered. One of the main obstacles is the lack of adverse weather benchmarks for the evaluation of 3DSOT. To this end, this work proposes a challenging benchmark for LiDAR-based 3DSOT in adverse weather, which comprises two synthetic datasets (KITTI-A and nuScenes-A) and one real-world dataset (CADC-SOT) spanning three weather types: rain, fog, and snow. Based on this benchmark, five representative 3D trackers from different tracking frameworks conducted robustness evaluation, resulting in significant performance degradations. This prompts the question: What are the factors that cause current advanced methods to fail on such adverse weather samples? Consequently, we explore the impacts of adverse weather and answer the above question from three perspectives: 1) target distance; 2) template shape corruption; and 3) target shape corruption. Finally, based on domain randomization and contrastive learning, we designed a dual-branch tracking framework for adverse weather, named DRCT, achieving excellent performance in benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Generalizing Weather Forecast to Fine-grained Temporal Scales via Physics-AI Hybrid Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13796v5)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and nowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which generalizes weather forecasts to finer-grained temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, effectively generalizes forecasts across multiple time scales, including 30-minute, which is even smaller than the dataset's temporal resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning and Foundation Models for Weather Prediction: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06907v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-based numerical models have been the bedrock of atmospheric sciences for decades, offering robust solutions but often at the cost of significant computational resources. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as powerful tools in meteorology, capable of analyzing complex weather and climate data by learning intricate dependencies and providing rapid predictions once trained. While these models demonstrate promising performance in weather prediction, often surpassing traditional physics-based methods, they still face critical challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent deep learning and foundation models for weather prediction. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing models based on their training paradigms: deterministic predictive learning, probabilistic generative learning, and pre-training and fine-tuning. For each paradigm, we delve into the underlying model architectures, address major challenges, offer key insights, and propose targeted directions for future research. Furthermore, we explore real-world applications of these methods and provide a curated summary of open-source code repositories and widely used datasets, aiming to bridge research advancements with practical implementations while fostering open and trustworthy scientific practices in adopting cutting-edge artificial intelligence for weather prediction.

| **[Generalizable Autonomous Driving System across Diverse Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14737v3)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to autonomous driving (AD) street scene semantic understanding (segmentation). A common strategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather conditions. However, this technique typically relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in practice. Furthermore, this method typically targets a single adverse condition, and thus perform poorly when confronting a mixture of multiple adverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse weather-Immune scheme (called AdvImmu) that leverages the invariance of weather conditions over short periods (seconds). Specifically, AdvImmu includes three components: Locally Sequential Mechanism (LSM), Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM), and Unfolded Regularizers (URs). LSM leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to enhance model performance. GSM is proposed to shuffle LSM segments to prevent overfitting of temporal patterns. URs are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather generalization. In addition, to overcome the over-reliance on consecutive frame-wise annotations in the training of AdvImmu (typically unavailable in AD scenarios), we incorporate a foundation model named Segment Anything Model (SAM) to assist to annotate frames, and additionally propose a cluster algorithm (denoted as SBICAC) to surmount SAM's category-agnostic issue to generate pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AdvImmu outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 88.56% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).</p></details> | 16 Pages |

In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Then a convex optimization problem is formulated to achieve various control specifications involving not only quadratic functions but also absolute values and maximum values of the controlled variables and initial atmospheric variables in the cost function and constraints. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using the NWP model.

Despite the existence of several datasets, scenes from adverse weather conditions are rarely available. This limits the robustness of downstream machine learning models, and restrains the reliability of autonomous driving systems in particular locations and seasons. Collecting feature-diverse scenes under adverse weather conditions is challenging due to seasonal limitations. Generative models are therefore essentials, especially for generating adverse weather conditions for specific driving scenarios. In our work, we propose a latent diffusion process constituted by autoencoder and latent diffusion models. Moreover, we leverage the clear condition LiDAR scenes with a postprocessing step to improve the realism of the generated adverse weather condition scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an intermediate version of our work</p></details> |

Solar and wind power are two of the most dominant renewable energy sources. The accurate forecasting of the energy generation of those sources facilitates their integration into electric grids, by minimizing the negative impact of uncertainty regarding their management and operation. This paper proposes a novel methodology for deterministic wind and solar energy generation forecasting for multiple generation sites, utilizing multi-location weather forecasts. The method employs a U-shaped Temporal Convolutional Auto-Encoder (UTCAE) architecture for temporal processing of weather-related and energy-related time-series across each site. The Multi-sized Kernels convolutional Spatio-Temporal Attention (MKST-Attention), inspired by the multi-head scaled-dot product attention mechanism, is also proposed aiming to efficiently transfer temporal patterns from weather data to energy data, without a priori knowledge of the locations of the power stations and the locations of provided weather data. The conducted experimental evaluation on a day-ahead solar and wind energy forecasting scenario on five datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieves top results, outperforming all competitive time-series forecasting state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Learning Weather Models from Data with WSINDy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00738v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension. Moreover, we develop an approach for handling terms that are not integrable-by-parts, such as advection operators.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we first fine-tune the SD with source data, aligning the content and layout of generated samples with real-world driving scenarios. Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM, which can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more diverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation strategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed classes under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This segmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of existing models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic data. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can significantly improve the segmentation performance of different state-of-the-art models on target domains. Notably, in the setting of ''Cityscapes to ACDC'', our method improves the baseline HRDA by 13.9% in mIoU.</p></details> |  |

Our framework employs differentiable preprocessing filters to perform image enhancement suitable for later-stage object detections. Our framework introduces two differentiable filters: a B\'ezier curve-based pixel-wise (BPW) filter and a kernel-based local (KBL) filter. These filters unify the functions of classical image processing filters and improve performance of object detection. We also propose a domain-agnostic data augmentation strategy using the BPW filter. Our method does not require data-specific customization of the filter combinations, parameter ranges, and data augmentation. We evaluate our proposed approach, called Enhanced Robustness by Unified Image Processing (ERUP)-YOLO, by applying it to the YOLOv3 detector. Experiments on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that our proposed filters match or exceed the expressiveness of conventional methods and our ERUP-YOLO achieved superior performance in a wide range of adverse weather conditions, including fog and low-light conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

However, a less-explored approach involves training AIWP models directly on observational data, enhancing computational efficiency and improving forecast accuracy by reducing the uncertainties introduced through data assimilation processes. In this study, we propose OMG-HD, a novel AI-based regional high-resolution weather forecasting model designed to make predictions directly from observational data sources, including surface stations, radar, and satellite, thereby removing the need for operational data assimilation. Our evaluation shows that OMG-HD outperforms both the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s high-resolution operational forecasting system, IFS-HRES, and the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model at lead times of up to 12 hours across the contiguous United States (CONUS) region. We achieve up to a 13% improvement on RMSE for 2-meter temperature, 17% on 10-meter wind speed, 48% on 2-meter specific humidity, and 32% on surface pressure compared to HRRR. Our method shows that it is possible to use AI-driven approaches for rapid weather predictions without relying on NWP-derived weather fields as model input. This is a promising step towards using observational data directly to make operational forecasts with AIWP models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A physics-engineering-economic model coupling approach for estimating the socio-economic impacts of space weather scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18032v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing concern about our vulnerability to space weather hazards and the disruption critical infrastructure failures could cause to society and the economy. However, the socio-economic impacts of space weather hazards, such as from geomagnetic storms, remain under-researched. This study introduces a novel framework to estimate the economic impacts of electricity transmission infrastructure failure due to space weather. By integrating existing geophysical and geomagnetically induced current (GIC) estimation models with a newly developed geospatial model of the Continental United States power grid, GIC vulnerabilities are assessed for a range of space weather scenarios. The approach evaluates multiple power network architectures, incorporating input-output economic modeling to translate business and population disruptions into macroeconomic impacts from GIC-related thermal heating failures. The results indicate a daily GDP loss from 6 billion USD to over 10 billion USD. Even under conservative GIC thresholds (75 A/ph) aligned with thermal withstand limits from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), significant economic disruptions are evident. This study is limited by its restriction to thermal heating analysis, though GICs can also affect the grid through other pathways, such as voltage instability and harmonic distortions. Addressing these other failure mechanisms need to be the focus of future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reproducible Method for Mapping Electricity Transmission Infrastructure for Space Weather Risk Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17685v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the potential application of various AI-powered, IoT-based, low-cost platforms for local weather forecasting to enable smart farming. Despite the increasing demand for this topic, a few promising studies have explored this area. This paper developed a conceptual research framework based on a systematic review of relevant literature and employed a case study method to validate the framework. The framework comprised five key components: the Data Acquisition Layer, Data Storage Layer, Data Processing Layer, Application Layer, and Decision-Making Layer.

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning weather forecasting models trained with the next state prediction objective on ERA5 have shown great success compared to numerical global circulation models. However, for a wide range of applications, being able to provide representative samples from the distribution of possible future weather states is critical. In this paper, we propose a methodology to leverage deterministic weather models in the design of probabilistic weather models, leading to improved performance and reduced computing costs. We first introduce \textbf{ArchesWeather}, a transformer-based deterministic model that improves upon Pangu-Weather by removing overrestrictive inductive priors. We then design a probabilistic weather model called \textbf{ArchesWeatherGen} based on flow matching, a modern variant of diffusion models, that is trained to project ArchesWeather's predictions to the distribution of ERA5 weather states. ArchesWeatherGen is a true stochastic emulator of ERA5 and surpasses IFS ENS and NeuralGCM on all WeatherBench headline variables (except for NeuralGCM's geopotential). Our work also aims to democratize the use of deterministic and generative machine learning models in weather forecasting research, with academic computing resources. All models are trained at 1.5{\deg} resolution, with a training budget of $\sim$9 V100 days for ArchesWeather and $\sim$45 V100 days for ArchesWeatherGen. For inference, ArchesWeatherGen generates 15-day weather trajectories at a rate of 1 minute per ensemble member on a A100 GPU card.

Existing methods have limited effectiveness in improving essential computer vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and often focus on only one specific condition, such as removing rain or translating nighttime images into daytime ones. To address these limitations, we propose a method to improve the visual quality and clarity degraded by such adverse conditions. Our method, AllWeather-Net, utilizes a novel hierarchical architecture to enhance images across all adverse conditions. This architecture incorporates information at three semantic levels: scene, object, and texture, by discriminating patches at each level. Furthermore, we introduce a Scaled Illumination-aware Attention Mechanism (SIAM) that guides the learning towards road elements critical for autonomous driving perception. SIAM exhibits robustness, remaining unaffected by changes in weather conditions or environmental scenes. AllWeather-Net effectively transforms images into normal weather and daytime scenes, demonstrating superior image enhancement results and subsequently enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation, with up to a 5.3% improvement in mIoU in the trained domain. We also show our model's generalization ability by applying it to unseen domains without re-training, achieving up to 3.9% mIoU improvement.

| **[Gradient-Boosted Mixture Regression Models for Postprocessing Ensemble Weather Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09583v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, weather forecasts are commonly generated by ensemble forecasts based on multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models. However, such forecasts are usually miscalibrated and/or biased, thus require statistical postprocessing. Non-homogeneous regression models, such as the ensemble model output statistics are frequently applied to correct these forecasts. Nonetheless, these methods often rely on the assumption of an unimodal parametric distribution, leading to improved, but sometimes not fully calibrated forecasts. To address this issue, a mixture regression model is presented, where the ensemble forecasts of each exchangeable group are linked to only one mixture component and mixture weight, called mixture of model output statistics (MIXMOS). In order to remove location specific effects and to use a longer training data, the standardized anomalies of the response and the ensemble forecasts are employed for the mixture of standardized anomaly model output statistics (MIXSAMOS). As carefully selected covariates, e.g. from different weather variables, can enhance model performance, the non-cyclic gradient-boosting algorithm for mixture regression models is introduced. Furthermore, MIXSAMOS is extended by this gradient-boosting algorithm (MIXSAMOS-GB) providing an automatic variable selection. The novel mixture regression models substantially outperform state-of-the-art postprocessing models in a case study for 2m surface temperature forecasts in Germany.</p></details> |  |

Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE.

However, its adoption remains limited among scientists outside the deep learning community due to storage, compute, and technical expertise barriers. To address this, we introduce Climplicit, a spatio-temporal geolocation encoder pretrained to generate implicit climatic representations anywhere on Earth. By bypassing the need to download raw climatic rasters and train feature extractors, our model uses x3500 less disk space and significantly reduces computational needs for downstream tasks. We evaluate our Climplicit embeddings on biomes classification, species distribution modeling, and plant trait regression. We find that single-layer probing our Climplicit embeddings consistently performs better or on par with training a model from scratch on downstream tasks and overall better than alternative geolocation encoding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Using Reinforcement Learning to Integrate Subjective Wellbeing into Climate Adaptation Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10031v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subjective wellbeing is a fundamental aspect of human life, influencing life expectancy and economic productivity, among others. Mobility plays a critical role in maintaining wellbeing, yet the increasing frequency and intensity of both nuisance and high-impact floods due to climate change are expected to significantly disrupt access to activities and destinations, thereby affecting overall wellbeing. Addressing climate adaptation presents a complex challenge for policymakers, who must select and implement policies from a broad set of options with varying effects while managing resource constraints and uncertain climate projections. In this work, we propose a multi-modular framework that uses reinforcement learning as a decision-support tool for climate adaptation in Copenhagen, Denmark. Our framework integrates four interconnected components: long-term rainfall projections, flood modeling, transport accessibility, and wellbeing modeling. This approach enables decision-makers to identify spatial and temporal policy interventions that help sustain or enhance subjective wellbeing over time. By modeling climate adaptation as an open-ended system, our framework provides a structured framework for exploring and evaluating adaptation policy pathways. In doing so, it supports policymakers to make informed decisions that maximize wellbeing in the long run.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Unlike most state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE remains stable and physically consistent for $100$ years of autoregressive simulation with $100$ ensemble members. Long-term mean climatology from LUCIE's simulation of temperature, wind, precipitation, and humidity matches that of ERA5 data, along with the variability. We further demonstrate how well extreme weather events and their return periods can be estimated from a large ensemble of long-term simulations. We further discuss an improved training strategy with a hard-constrained first-order integrator to suppress autoregressive error growth, a novel spectral regularization strategy to better capture fine-scale dynamics, and finally an optimization algorithm that enables data-limited (as low as $2$ years of $6$-hourly data) training of the emulator without losing stability and physical consistency. Finally, we provide a scaling experiment to compare the long-term bias of LUCIE with respect to the number of training samples. Importantly, LUCIE is an easy to use model that can be trained in just $2.4$h on a single A-100 GPU, allowing for multiple experiments that can explore important scientific questions that could be answered with large ensembles of long-term simulations, e.g., the impact of different variables on the simulation, dynamic response to external forcing, and estimation of extreme weather events, amongst others.</p></details> |  |

In addition to the most common task of weather forecasting, several pioneering benchmark works are proposed for extending the modality, such as domain-specific applications like tropical cyclone intensity prediction and flash flood damage estimation, or climate statement and confidence level in the format of natural language. To further motivate the artificial general intelligence development for climate science, in this paper, we first contribute a multi-modal climate benchmark, i.e., ClimateBench-M, which aligns (1) the time series climate data from ERA5, (2) extreme weather events data from NOAA, and (3) satellite image data from NASA HLS based on a unified spatial-temporal granularity. Second, under each data modality, we also propose a simple but strong generative method that could produce competitive performance in weather forecasting, thunderstorm alerts, and crop segmentation tasks in the proposed ClimateBench-M. The data and code of ClimateBench-M are publicly available at https://github.com/iDEA-iSAIL-Lab-UIUC/ClimateBench-M.</p></details> | Preprint, 29 pages |

To guide this transition, integrated assessment models map sectoral emissions reduction targets into long-term trajectories towards carbon neutrality at the macro-level, while detailed engineering studies at the micro-level develop concrete carbon-mitigation technologies tailored to individual industries. However, we lack a meso-level understanding of how solutions connect across technological domains. Building on the notion that innovating often entails combining existing technologies in new ways, we identify Green Building Blocks (GBBs): modules of technologies that can be added to nongreen technologies to mitigate their climate-change impact. Using natural language processing and dimensionality reduction techniques, we show how GBBs can be extracted from large-scale patent data. Next, we describe the anatomy of the green transition as a network that connects nongreen technologies to GBBs. This network has a nontrivial structure: whereas some nongreen technologies can connect to various GBBs, opening up a variety of ways to mitigate their impact on the global climate, other nongreen technologies only connect to a single GBB. Similarly, some GBBs are general purpose technologies that can reduce green house gases in a vast range of applications, whereas others are tailored to specific use cases. Furthermore, GBBs prove predictive of the green technologies that firms develop, allowing us to map the green capabilities of firms not in terms of the specific green technological solutions they invent, but in terms of their capacity to develop broader classes of solutions with the GBBs they possess.</p></details> |  |

This has motivated use of regional convection-permitting climate models (CPMs), but these are very computationally expensive. We present a convection-permitting model generative emulator (CPMGEM), to skilfully emulate precipitation simulations by a 2.2km-resolution regional CPM at much lower cost. This utilises a generative machine learning approach, a diffusion model. It takes inputs at the 60km resolution of the driving global climate model and downscales these to 8.8km, with daily-mean time resolution, capturing the effect of convective processes represented in the CPM at these scales. The emulator is trained on simulations over England and Wales from the United Kingdom Climate Projections Local product, covering years between 1980 and 2080 following a high emissions scenario. The output precipitation has a similarly realistic spatial structure and intensity distribution to the CPM simulations. The emulator is stochastic, which improves the realism of samples. We show evidence that the emulator has skill for extreme events with ~100 year return times. It captures the main features of the simulated 21st century climate change, but exhibits some error in the magnitude. We demonstrate successful transfer from a "perfect model" training setting to application using GCM variable inputs. We also show that the method can be useful in situations with limited amounts of high-resolution data. Potential applications include producing high-resolution precipitation predictions for large-ensemble climate simulations and producing output based on different GCMs and climate change scenarios to better sample uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables; re-ordered sections; further evaluation of future change in heavy precipitation</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce an LLM-based agentic AI system that integrates contextual retrieval, fine-tuning, and multi-step reasoning to extract relevant financial data, classify investments, and ensure compliance with funding guidelines. Our study focuses on a real-world application: tracking EWS investments in the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Fund. We analyze 25 MDB project documents and evaluate multiple AI-driven classification methods, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and an agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. Our results show that the agent-based RAG approach significantly outperforms other methods, achieving 87\% accuracy, 89\% precision, and 83\% recall. Additionally, we contribute a benchmark dataset and expert-annotated corpus, providing a valuable resource for future research in AI-driven financial tracking and climate finance transparency.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores a model predictive control (MPC) approach for building climate control, aimed at minimizing the noise nuisance generated by HPs. By exploiting a piecewise linear approximation of HP noise patterns and assuming linear building thermal dynamics, the proposed design can be generalized to handle various HP acoustic patterns with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, two computationally efficient options for defining the noise cost function in the proposed MPC design are discussed. Numerical experiments on a high-fidelity building simulator are performed to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the noise pollution caused by HPs with negligible energy cost increase.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted to ECC2025</p></details> |

Though climate change dominates social media, analyzing its multimodal expressions is understudied, and current tools have failed to determine whether LLMs amplify credible solutions or spread unsubstantiated claims. To address this, we introduce CliME (Climate Change Multimodal Evaluation), a first-of-its-kind multimodal dataset, comprising 2579 Twitter and Reddit posts. The benchmark features a diverse collection of humorous memes and skeptical posts, capturing how these formats distill complex issues into viral narratives that shape public opinion and policy discussions. To systematically evaluate LLM performance, we present the Climate Alignment Quotient (CAQ), a novel metric comprising five distinct dimensions: Articulation, Evidence, Resonance, Transition, and Specificity. Additionally, we propose three analytical lenses: Actionability, Criticality, and Justice, to guide the assessment of LLM-generated climate discourse using CAQ. Our findings, based on the CAQ metric, indicate that while most evaluated LLMs perform relatively well in Criticality and Justice, they consistently underperform on the Actionability axis. Among the models evaluated, Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves the highest overall performance. We publicly release our CliME dataset and code to foster further research in this domain.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

By leveraging a high-fidelity nonlinear HVAC model, the system behavior is captured in a lifted higher-dimensional state space, enabling a linear representation. A comparative analysis of three Koopman-based system identification approaches (polynomial libraries, radial basis functions (RBF), and neural network-based dictionary learning) is conducted. Accurate prediction of power consumption over entire driving cycles is demonstrated by incorporating power as a measurable output within the Koopman framework. The performance of each method is rigorously evaluated through simulations under various driving cycles and ambient conditions, highlighting their potential for real-time prediction and control in energy-efficient vehicle climate management. This study offers a scalable, data-driven methodology that can be extended to other complex nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 6 pages, conference |
| **[Granger causal inference for climate change attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16004v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change detection and attribution (D&A) is concerned with determining the extent to which anthropogenic activities have influenced specific aspects of the global climate system. D&A fits within the broader field of causal inference, the collection of statistical methods that identify cause and effect relationships. There are a wide variety of methods for making attribution statements, each of which require different types of input data and each of which are conditional to varying extents. Some methods are based on Pearl causality (experimental interference) while others leverage Granger (predictive) causality, and the causal framing provides important context for how the resulting attribution conclusion should be interpreted. However, while Granger-causal attribution analyses have become more common, there is no clear statement of their strengths and weaknesses and no clear consensus on where and when Granger-causal perspectives are appropriate. In this prospective paper, we provide a formal definition for Granger-based approaches to trend and event attribution and a clear comparison with more traditional methods for assessing the human influence on extreme weather and climate events. Broadly speaking, Granger-causal attribution statements can be constructed quickly from observations and do not require computationally-intesive dynamical experiments. These analyses also enable rapid attribution, which is useful in the aftermath of a severe weather event, and provide multiple lines of evidence for anthropogenic climate change when paired with Pearl-causal attribution. Confidence in attribution statements is increased when different methodologies arrive at similar conclusions. Moving forward, we encourage the D&A community to embrace hybrid approaches to climate change attribution that leverage the strengths of both Granger and Pearl causality.</p></details> |  |

In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system acts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without premium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for soybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze historical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate case) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions strongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data into volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate conditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather and price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put option, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium, quantifying its fiscal cost. We propose this novel market-based risk-hedging mechanism wherein the government purchases insurance equivalent to MSP, leveraging Black-Scholes for accurate premium estimation. Our results underscore the importance of meteorological data in agricultural risk modeling, supporting targeted insurance and strengthening resilience in agricultural finance. This climate-informed financial framework enhances risk-sharing, stabilizes prices, and informs sustainable agricultural policy under growing climate uncertainty.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The impact of internal variability on benchmarking deep learning climate emulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05288v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We compare these deep learning emulators with a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and show that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved climate variables, notably surface temperature and precipitation. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. Precipitation is a much more noisy variable, and we show that deep learning emulators can overfit to internal variability noise at low frequencies, degrading their performance in comparison to a linear emulator. We address the issue of overfitting by increasing the number of climate simulations per emission pathway (from 3 to 50) and updating the benchmark targets with the respective ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based technique for emulating precipitation. We publish our code and data at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Transformer-Based Flood Susceptibility Mapping: Application to the French Riviera and Railway Infrastructure Under Climate Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03727v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing flood frequency and severity due to climate change threatens infrastructure and demands improved susceptibility mapping techniques. While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Science of Total Environment journal</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Seasonal Climate Predictions via Variational Inference and Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20466v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most operational climate services providers base their seasonal predictions on initialised general circulation models (GCMs) or statistical techniques that fit past observations. GCMs require substantial computational resources, which limits their capacity. In contrast, statistical methods often lack robustness due to short historical records. Recent works propose machine learning methods trained on climate model output, leveraging larger sample sizes and simulated scenarios. Yet, many of these studies focus on prediction tasks that might be restricted in spatial extent or temporal coverage, opening a gap with existing operational predictions. Thus, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of a methodology that combines variational inference with transformer models to predict fields of seasonal anomalies. The predictions cover all four seasons and are initialised one month before the start of each season. The model was trained on climate model output from CMIP6 and tested using ERA5 reanalysis data. We analyse the method's performance in predicting interannual anomalies beyond the climate change-induced trend. We also test the proposed methodology in a regional context with a use case focused on Europe. While climate change trends dominate the skill of temperature predictions, the method presents additional skill over the climatological forecast in regions influenced by known teleconnections. We reach similar conclusions based on the validation of precipitation predictions. Despite underperforming SEAS5 in most tropics, our model offers added value in numerous extratropical inland regions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of training generative models on climate model output for seasonal predictions, providing skilful predictions beyond the induced climate change trend at time scales and lead times relevant for user applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Climate Change Impacts on Renewable Energy Generation: A Super-Resolution Recurrent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11399v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by global climate change and the ongoing energy transition, the coupling between power supply capabilities and meteorological factors has become increasingly significant. Over the long term, accurately quantifying the power generation of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty. The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate data. Furthermore, the research highlights the estimation biases introduced when low-resolution climate data is used for power conversion.</p></details> |  |

The next frontier is to build emulators for long climate simulations with skill across a range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multidepth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remain stable, requiring further work.</p></details> |  |

Public understanding of climate issues and of the goals regarding the climate transition is essential to translate awareness into concrete actions. Social media platforms play a crucial role in disseminating information about climate change and climate policy. In this context, we propose a model that analyses the Supply and Demand of information to better understand information circulation and information voids within the Italian climate-transition discourse. We conceptualise information supply as the production of content on Facebook and Instagram while leveraging Google searches to capture information demand. Our findings highlight the persistence of information voids, which can hinder informed decision-making and collective action. Furthermore, we observe that the dynamics of information supply and demand on climate-related topics tend to intensify in response to significant external events, shaping public attention and social media discourse.</p></details> |  |

To better simulate these conditions, physically-based NeRF rendering methods have been explored for their ability to generate realistic scene representations. However, these methods suffer from slow rendering speeds and long preprocessing times, making them impractical for real-time testing and user interaction. This paper presents ClimateGS, a novel framework integrating 3D Gaussian representations with physical simulation to enable real-time climate effects rendering. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a linear transformation for 3D Gaussian photorealistic style transfer, enabling direct modification of spherical harmonics across bands for efficient and consistent style adaptation; 2) developing a joint training strategy for 3D style transfer, combining supervised and self-supervised learning to accelerate convergence while preserving original scene details; 3) developing a real-time rendering method for climate simulation, integrating physics-based effects with 3D Gaussian to achieve efficient and realistic rendering. We evaluate ClimateGS on MipNeRF360 and Tanks and Temples, demonstrating real-time rendering with comparable or superior visual quality to SOTA 2D/3D methods, making it suitable for interactive applications.</p></details> |  |

These factors can exhibit interactive impacts on ecosystem services. The study reviewed a large number of papers on the climate change-islands-ecosystem services topic worldwide. Potential inclusion of land use changes and other drivers of impacts on ecosystem services were sequentially also recorded. The study sought to investigate the impacts of climate change, land use change, and other non-climatic driver changes on island ecosystem services. Explanatory variables examined were divided into two categories: environmental variables and methodological ones. Environmental variables include sea zone geographic location, ecosystem, ecosystem services, climate, land use, other driver variables, Methodological variables include consideration of policy interventions, uncertainty assessment, cumulative effects of climate change, synergistic effects of climate change with land use change and other anthropogenic and environmental drivers, and the diversity of variables used in the analysis. Machine learning and statistical methods were used to analyze their effects on island ecosystem services. Negative climate change impacts on ecosystem services are better quantified by land use change or other non-climatic driver variables than by climate variables. The synergy of land use together with climate changes is modulating the impact outcome and critical for a better impact assessment. Analyzed together, there is little evidence of more pronounced for a specific sea zone, ecosystem, or ecosystem service. Climate change impacts may be underestimated due to the use of a single climate variable deployed in most studies. Policy interventions exhibit low classification accuracy in quantifying impacts indicating insufficient efficacy or integration in the studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article published in the journal: Science of the Total Environment.

Activists, policymakers, and researchers seek to understand public sentiment and narratives while access to social media data has become increasingly restricted in the post-API era. In this study, we analyze a dataset of climate change-related tweets from X (formerly Twitter) shared in 2019, containing 730k tweets along with the shared images. Our approach integrates statistical analysis, image classification, object detection, and sentiment analysis to explore visual narratives in climate discourse. Additionally, we introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interactive data exploration. Our findings reveal key themes in climate communication, highlight sentiment divergence between images and text, and underscore the strengths and limitations of foundation models in analyzing social media imagery. By releasing our code and tools, we aim to support future research on the intersection of climate change, social media, and computer vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk Assessment of Distribution Networks Considering Climate Change and Vegetation Management Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09239v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive risk assessment model for power distribution networks with a focus on the influence of climate conditions and vegetation management on outage risks. Using a dataset comprising outage records, meteorological indicators, and vegetation metrics, this paper develops a logistic regression model that outperformed several alternatives, effectively identifying risk factors in highly imbalanced data. Key features impacting outages include wind speed, vegetation density, quantified as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and snow type, with wet snow and autumn conditions exhibiting the strongest positive effects. The analysis also shows complex interactions, such as the combined effect of wind speed and EVI, suggesting that vegetation density can moderate the impact of high winds on outages. Simulation case studies, based on a test dataset of 618 samples, demonstrated that the model achieved an 80\% match rate with real-world data within an error tolerance of \(\pm 0.05\), showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model while highlighting its potential to inform preventive strategies for mitigating outage risks in power distribution networks under high-risk environmental conditions. Future work will integrate vegetation height data from Lidar and explore alternative modeling approaches to capture potential non-linear relationships.</p></details> |  |

This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15993v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and attributing temperature increases driven by climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and informing adaptation strategies. However, distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability remains challenging for traditional detection and attribution (D&A) methods, which rely on identifying specific "fingerprints" -- spatial patterns expected to emerge from external forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions. Deep learning offers promise in discerning these complex patterns within expansive spatial datasets, yet the lack of standardized protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies. To address this gap, we introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset comprising 1.17M daily climate snapshots paired with target climate change indicator variables. The dataset is curated from both CMIP6 climate model simulations and real-world observation-assimilated reanalysis datasets (ERA5, JRA-3Q, and MERRA-2), and is designed to enhance model accuracy in detecting climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in previous research, ensuring comparability and consistency across studies. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data -- a novel approach that, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before for climate change detection tasks. Our open-access data serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science by enabling end-to-end model development and evaluation. ClimDetect is publicly accessible via Hugging Face dataset repository at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimDetect/ClimDetect.</p></details> |  |

We also propose the use of machine learning regression methods to calibrate CO2 data from this cost-effective sensing platform to a reference sensor at the South African Weather Service's Cape Point measurement facility. We show the performance of these methods and found that Random Forest Regression was the best in this scenario. This shows that these machine learning methods can be used to improve the performance of cost-effective sensor platforms and possibly extend the time between manual calibration of sensor networks.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical issue remains: the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of assessing the quality and scientific validity of model outputs. To address this issue, we develop ClimaGen (Climate QA Generator), an adaptive learning framework that generates question-answer pairs from graduate textbooks with climate scientists in the loop. As a result, we present ClimaQA-Gold, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset alongside ClimaQA-Silver, a large-scale, comprehensive synthetic QA dataset for climate science. Finally, we develop evaluation strategies and compare different LLMs on our benchmarks. Our results offer novel insights into various approaches used to enhance knowledge of climate LLMs. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/genie-climaqa</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) open-source models substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation compared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of proprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in classifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as incorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks that require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation, and 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to engage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading claims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Workshop on AI Governance: Alignment, Morality and Law (AIGOV) 2025.

Despite the significance of accounting for elevation-dependent precipitation changes in the Alpine region, they have not been extensively explored in regional climate studies. We investigate changes in precipitation patterns between two 10-year periods over the past 50 years in Austria. Specifically, we analyse real precipitation data for three scenarios: monthly mean, monthly maximum precipitation, and the monthly maximum length of a dry spell. We compute temporal difference maps to visualise these changes by comparing the average monthly precipitation scenario across the two decades 1973-1982 and 2013-2022. Our findings are essential for detecting fine-scale precipitation changes in Austria, identifying thresholds across space and time and creating the basis for political decision-makers.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 tables and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Generative assimilation and prediction for weather and climate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03038v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have shown great success in predicting weather up to two weeks ahead, outperforming process-based benchmarks. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the prediction task, and do not incorporate the necessary data assimilation. Moreover, these models suffer from error accumulation in long roll-outs, limiting their applicability to seasonal predictions or climate projections. Here, we introduce Generative Assimilation and Prediction (GAP), a unified deep generative framework for assimilation and prediction of both weather and climate. By learning to quantify the probabilistic distribution of atmospheric states under observational, predictive, and external forcing constraints, GAP excels in a broad range of weather-climate related tasks, including data assimilation, seamless prediction, and climate simulation. In particular, GAP is competitive with state-of-the-art ensemble assimilation, probabilistic weather forecast and seasonal prediction, yields stable millennial simulations, and reproduces climate variability from daily to decadal time scales.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a deep-learning-based multi-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning models. Using nine performance criteria, five K\"oppen-Geiger climate zones -- Tropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four seasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results show that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models. Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that multi-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and transformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This framework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate projections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Environmental Science and Pollution Research (ESPR) for review</p></details> |

However, the nascent discourse that is emerging on sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) has predominantly focused on the environmental sustainability of AI, often neglecting the economic and social aspects. Achieving truly sustainable AI necessitates addressing the tension between its climate awareness and its social sustainability, which hinges on equitable access to AI development resources. The concept of resource awareness advocates for broader access to the infrastructure required to develop AI, fostering equity in AI innovation. Yet, this push for improving accessibility often overlooks the environmental costs of expanding such resource usage. In this position paper, we argue that reconciling climate and resource awareness is essential to realizing the full potential of sustainable AI. We use the framework of base-superstructure to analyze how the material conditions are influencing the current AI discourse. We also introduce the Climate and Resource Aware Machine Learning (CARAML) framework to address this conflict and propose actionable recommendations spanning individual, community, industry, government, and global levels to achieve sustainable AI.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we explore Arctic Sea ice extent data to identify teleconnection with weather change in the polar and sub-tropical jet stream intersection in eastern United States (US) and hence the potential influence in ground level ozone pollution. Several statistical methods including Bayesian techniques such as: spatio-temporal modelling and Bayesian network are implemented to identify the teleconnection and also validated based on theories in atmospheric science. We observe that the teleconnection is relatively strong in autumn, winter and spring seasons compared to the summer. Furthermore, the sudden decremental effect of Arctic sea-ice extent in mid-2000s has a shifting influence in ozone pollutions compared to the previous years. A similar downward shift in the Arctic sea-ice extent has been projected in 2030. These findings indicate to initiate further strategic policies for the Arctic influence, ozone concentrations together the seasonal and global changing patterns of climate.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Implementing such measures, including the development of resilient infrastructure and retrofitting existing systems, demands substantial financial investment. Unfortunately, due to the unprofitability stemming from the long-term returns, uncertainty, and complexity of infrastructure adaptation projects and the short-term profit-seeking objectives of private capital, a massive financial gap remains. This study suggests incentivizing private capital to bridge financial gaps through integrated carbon markets. Specifically, the framework combines carbon taxes and carbon markets to involve infrastructure and individuals in the climate mitigation phase, using the funds collected for climate adaptation. Moreover, it integrates lifestyle reformation, environmental mitigation, and infrastructure adaptation to establish harmonized standards and provide circular positive feedback to sustain the markets. We further explore how integrated carbon markets can facilitate fund collection and discuss the challenges of incorporating them into infrastructure climate adaptation. This study aims to foster collaboration between private and public capital to enable a more scientific, rational, and actionable implementation of integrated carbon markets, thus supporting sustainable financial backing for infrastructure climate adaptation</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,2 figures,99 references</p></details> |

This study addresses this challenge by employing an innovative and computationally efficient hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning (ML) methods for time series forecasting with established statistical techniques. The spatiotemporal data undergo decomposition using time-dependent Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs), denoted as \(\phi_{k}(t)\), and their corresponding spatial coefficients, \(\alpha_{k}(s)\), to reduce dimensionality. Wavelet analysis provides high-resolution time and frequency information from the \(\phi_{k}(t)\) functions, while neural networks forecast these functions within a medium-range horizon \(h\). By utilizing various ML models, particularly a Wavelet - ANN hybrid model, we forecast \(\phi_{k}(t+h)\) up to a time horizon \(h\), and subsequently reconstruct the spatiotemporal data using these extended EOFs. This methodology is applied to a grid of climate data covering the territory of Chile. It transitions from a high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal data forecasting problem to a low-dimensional univariate forecasting problem. Additionally, cluster analysis with Dynamic Time Warping for defining similarities between rainfall time series, along with spatial coherence and predictability assessments, has been instrumental in identifying geographic areas where model performance is enhanced. This approach also elucidates the reasons behind poor forecast performance in regions or clusters with low spatial coherence and predictability. By utilizing cluster medoids, the forecasting process becomes more practical and efficient. This compound approach significantly reduces computational complexity while generating forecasts of reasonable accuracy and utility.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

First, we investigate the use of the LLM-as-a-Judge (LLMJ) methodology for scoring company-submitted reports on emissions reduction targets and progress. Second, we probe the behavior of an LLM when it is prompted to greenwash a response subject to accuracy and length constraints. Finally, we test the robustness of the LLMJ methodology against responses that may be greenwashed using an LLM. We find that two LLMJ scoring systems, numerical rating and pairwise comparison, are effective in distinguishing high-performing companies from others, with the pairwise comparison system showing greater robustness against LLM-greenwashed responses.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

However, current general circulation models (GCMs) face challenges in capturing unresolved physical processes, such as cloud and convection. A common solution is to adopt cloud resolving models, that provide more accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrisation schemes typically used in GCMs. However, cloud resolving models, also referred to as super paramtetrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling, which integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising alternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues. In this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a key factor compromising the stability of hybrid models. To address this, we introduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a self-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes. CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing simulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency compared to super parameterization schemes. We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained Neural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term stable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land. PCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it shows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the way for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing environmental forecasting research focuses narrowly on predicting numerical meteorological variables (e.g., temperature), neglecting the translation of these variables into actionable textual narratives of events and their consequences. To bridge this gap, we proposed Weather and Climate Event Forecasting (WCEF), a new task that leverages numerical meteorological raster data and textual event data to predict weather and climate events. This task is challenging to accomplish due to difficulties in aligning multimodal data and the lack of supervised datasets. To address these challenges, we present CLLMate, the first multimodal dataset for WCEF, using 26,156 environmental news articles aligned with ERA5 reanalysis data. We systematically benchmark 23 existing MLLMs on CLLMate, including closed-source, open-source, and our fine-tuned models. Our experiments reveal the advantages and limitations of existing MLLMs and the value of CLLMate for the training and benchmarking of the WCEF task.</p></details> |  |

In this exploratory study we i. Identify a number of interesting policy alternatives that are actively considered by local governments in the United States (and indeed around the world). ii. Identify a number of quality-of-life indicators as apt evaluation criteria for these policies. iii. Use GPT-4 to obtain evaluation scores for the policies on multiple criteria. iv. Use the TOPSIS MCDM method to rank the policies based on the obtained evaluation scores. v. Evaluate the quality and validity of the resulting table ensemble of scores by comparing the TOPSIS-based policy rankings with those obtained by an informed assessment exercise. We find that GPT-4 is in rough agreement with the policy rankings of our informed assessment exercise. Hence, we conclude (always provisionally and assuming a modest level of vetting) that GPT-4 can be used as a credible input, even starting point, for subsequent deliberation processes on climate and sustainability policies.</p></details> | 32 pages. 4 figures |

The Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets are experiencing rapid surface melting and increased freshwater runoff, contributing significantly to global sea level rise. Understanding the mechanisms driving snowmelt in these regions is crucial. ERA5, a widely used reanalysis dataset in polar climate studies, offers extensive climate variables and global data assimilation. However, its snowmelt model employs an energy imbalance approach that may oversimplify the complexity of surface melt. In contrast, the Glacier Energy and Mass Balance (GEMB) model incorporates additional physical processes, such as snow accumulation, firn densification, and meltwater percolation/refreezing, providing a more detailed representation of surface melt dynamics. In this research, we focus on analyzing surface snowmelt dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet using feature attribution for anomalous melt events in ERA5 and GEMB models. We present a novel unsupervised attribution method leveraging counterfactual explanation method to analyze detected anomalies in ERA5 and GEMB. Our anomaly detection results are validated using MEaSUREs ground-truth data, and the attributions are evaluated against established feature ranking methods, including XGBoost, Shapley values, and Random Forest. Our attribution framework identifies the physics behind each model and the climate features driving melt anomalies. These findings demonstrate the utility of our attribution method in enhancing the interpretability of anomalies in climate models and advancing our understanding of Arctic melt dynamics.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. We are releasing open-source versions of InvestESG in both PyTorch and JAX, which enable scalable and hardware-accelerated simulations for investigating competing incentives in mitigate climate change. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs.</p></details> |  |

Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and climate science on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. We also show that the observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy. Our findings highlight the dangers of entrenched cross-domain polarization manifesting as spillover of antagonistic behavior.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

In this study, we examine the use of scientific sources in the course of 14 years of public deliberation around climate change on one of the largest social media platforms, Reddit. We find that only 4.0% of the links in the Reddit posts, and 6.5% in the comments, point to domains of scientific sources, although these rates have been increasing in the past decades. These links are dwarfed, however, by the citations of mass media, newspapers, and social media, the latter of which peaked especially during 2019-2020. Further, scientific sources are more likely to be posted by users who also post links to sources having central-left political leaning, and less so by those posting more polarized sources. Unfortunately, scientific sources are not often used in response to links to unreliable sources.</p></details> |  |

We estimate global and climate zone annual maximum and annual means for period (2015, 2100) from daily output of seven GCMs for daily wind speed, maximum wind speed, solar irradiance and near-surface temperature. We calculate corresponding annualised data for individual locations within neighbourhoods of the North Atlantic and Celtic Sea region. We consider output for three climate scenarios and multiple climate ensembles. We estimate non-stationary extreme value models for annual extremes, and non-homogeneous Gaussian regressions for annual means, using Bayesian inference. We use estimated statistical models to quantify the distribution of (i) the change in 100-year return value for annual extremes, and (2) the change in annual mean, over the period (2025, 2125). To summarise results, we estimate linear mixed effects models for observed variation of (i) and (ii). Evidence for changes in the 100-year return value for annual maxima of solar irradiance and temperature is much stronger than for wind variables over time and with climate scenario.</p></details> |  |

We propose to take the best from both worlds by leveraging deep generative models to produce physically consistent oceanic states that can serve as initial conditions for climate projections. We assess the viability of this hybrid approach through both physical metrics and numerical experiments, and highlight the benefits of enforcing physical constraints during generation. Although we train here on ocean variables from idealized numerical simulations, we claim that this hybrid approach, combining the computational efficiency of deep learning with the physical accuracy of numerical models, can effectively reduce the computational burden of running climate models to equilibrium, and reduce uncertainties in climate projections by minimizing drifts in baseline simulations.</p></details> |  |

Natural-language processing (NLP) tools enhance and expand data collection and processing and knowledge utilization capabilities to support the definition of an inclusive, sustainable future. In this work, we apply different NLP techniques, tools and approaches to climate and sustainability documents to derive policy-relevant and actionable measures. We focus on general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) using a combination of static and prompt-based methods. We find that the use of LLMs is successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data. However, we also encounter challenges related to human intervention across different workflow stages and knowledge utilization for policy processes. Our work presents a critical but empirically grounded application of LLMs to complex policy problems and suggests avenues to further expand Artificial Intelligence-powered computational social sciences.</p></details> | 15 pages; 4 figures |

However, population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate change, notably the influence of temperatures on mortality. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected mortality using a multi-population mortality model. This method combines a stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model, predicting mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations, be it excesses or insufficiencies. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional mortality models. We illustrate this proposed mortality model using French data stratified by gender, focusing on past temperatures and mortality. Utilizing climate model predictions across various IPCC scenarios, we investigate gains and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality induced by extreme heatwaves, and quantify them by assessing this new risk factor in prediction intervals. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical differences across the Metropolitan France.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a mixed extreme value model to deal with maxima, which takes full advantage of both (i) hindcast or wave reanalysis and (ii) instrumental records, reducing the uncertainty in its predictions. The resulting mixed model consistently merges the information given by both kinds of data sets, and it can be applied to any extreme value analysis distribution, such as generalized extreme value, peaks over threshold or Pareto-Poisson. The methodology is illustrated using both synthetically generated and real data, the latter taken from a given location on the northern Spanish coast.</p></details> |  |

Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, additional supplementary text and figures</p></details> |
| **[Identification of Nonparametric Dynamic Causal Structure and Latent Process in Climate System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12500v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of learning causal structure with latent variables has advanced the understanding of the world by uncovering causal relationships and latent factors, e.g., Causal Representation Learning (CRL). However, in real-world scenarios, such as those in climate systems, causal relationships are often nonparametric, dynamic, and exist among both observed variables and latent variables. These challenges motivate us to consider a general setting in which causal relations are nonparametric and unrestricted in their occurrence, which is unconventional to current methods. To solve this problem, with the aid of 3-measurement in temporal structure, we theoretically show that both latent variables and processes can be identified up to minor indeterminacy under mild assumptions. Moreover, we tackle the general nonlinear Causal Discovery (CD) from observations, e.g., temperature, as a specific task of learning independent representation, through the principle of functional equivalence. Based on these insights, we develop an estimation approach simultaneously recovering both the observed causal structure and latent causal process in a nontrivial manner. Simulation studies validate the theoretical foundations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In the experiments involving climate data, this approach offers a powerful and in-depth understanding of the climate system.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reconstructing East Asian Temperatures from 1368 to 1911 Using Historical Documents, Climate Models, and Data Assimilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21790v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for reconstructing annual temperatures in East Asia from 1368 to 1911, leveraging the Reconstructed East Asian Climate Historical Encoded Series (REACHES). The lack of instrumental data during this period poses significant challenges to understanding past climate conditions. REACHES digitizes historical documents from the Ming and Qing dynasties of China, converting qualitative descriptions into a four-level ordinal temperature scale. However, these index-based data are biased toward abnormal or extreme weather phenomena, leading to data gaps that likely correspond to normal conditions. To address this bias and reconstruct historical temperatures at any point within East Asia, including locations without direct historical data, we employ a three-tiered statistical framework. First, we perform kriging to interpolate temperature data across East Asia, adopting a zero-mean assumption to handle missing information. Next, we utilize the Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) reanalysis data and apply quantile mapping to calibrate the kriged REACHES data to Celsius temperature scales. Finally, we introduce a novel Bayesian data assimilation method that integrates the kriged Celsius data with LME simulations to enhance reconstruction accuracy. We model the LME data at each geographic location using a flexible nonstationary autoregressive time series model and employ regularized maximum likelihood estimation with a fused lasso penalty. The resulting dynamic distribution serves as a prior, which is refined via Kalman filtering by incorporating the kriged Celsius REACHES data to yield posterior temperature estimates. This comprehensive integration of historical documentation, contemporary climate models, and advanced statistical methods improves the accuracy of historical temperature reconstructions and provides a crucial resource for future environmental and climate studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Moreover, a small perturbation in climatic changes affects not only the pristine ecosystem but also the socioeconomic sectors. Specifically, the affect of climatic changes is related to frequent casualties. This makes it essential to dwelve deeper into analyzing the socio-climatic trends and variability. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of India's climatic trends, emphasizing on regional variations and specifically delving into the unique climate of Delhi. Specifically, this research unveils the temporal and spatial variations in temperature patterns by amalgamating extensive datasets encompassing India's diverse landscapes. The study uses advanced statistical tools and methodologies to scrutinize temperature's annual and seasonal variability. The insights drawn from this rigorous analysis may offer invaluable contributions to regional planning strategies, adaptive measures, and informed decision-making amidst the complex impacts of climate change. By bridging the gap between broader climatic trends and localized impacts, this research aims to facilitate more effective measures to mitigate and adapt to the multifaceted challenges of climate change, ensuring a more nuanced and tailored approaches. We utilized the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen's slope estimator to analyze the trends and variability of the climatic conditions over the decades. The results demonstrate that temperature variations have increased over 0.58oC on average over the last decade. Moreover, over last decade the variability of Indian states shows that Lakshadweep faced the highest change (0.87oC), highlighting coastal vulnerability, while Tripura observed the least change of 0.07oC.</p></details> |  |

Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they "generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate 100% precision in retrieving rare destructive storms using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>minor...</summary><p>minor corrections and editing</p></details> |

| **[Predicting Soil Macronutrient Levels: A Machine Learning Approach Models Trained on pH, Conductivity, and Average Power of Acid-Base Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04138v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soil macronutrients, particularly potassium ions (K$^+$), are indispensable for plant health, underpinning various physiological and biological processes, and facilitating the management of both biotic and abiotic stresses. Deficient macronutrient content results in stunted growth, delayed maturation, and increased vulnerability to environmental stressors, thereby accentuating the imperative for precise soil nutrient monitoring. Traditional techniques such as chemical assays, atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods, albeit advanced, are prohibitively expensive and time-intensive, thus unsuitable for real-time macronutrient assessment. In this study, we propose an innovative soil testing protocol utilizing a dataset derived from synthetic solutions to model soil behaviour. The dataset encompasses physical properties including conductivity and pH, with a concentration on three key macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Four machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, with random forest regressors and neural networks being selected for the prediction of soil nutrient concentrations. Comparative analysis with laboratory soil testing results revealed prediction errors of 23.6% for phosphorus and 16% for potassium using the random forest model, and 26.3% for phosphorus and 21.8% for potassium using the neural network model. This methodology illustrates a cost-effective and efficacious strategy for real-time soil nutrient monitoring, offering substantial advancements over conventional techniques and enhancing the capability to sustain optimal nutrient levels conducive to robust crop growth.</p></details> |  |

The AgroLens project endeavors to address this challenge by develop ing Machine Learning (ML)-based methodologies to predict soil nutrient levels without reliance on laboratory tests. By leveraging state of the art techniques, the project lays a foundation for acionable insights to improve agricultural productivity in resource-constrained areas, such as Africa. The approach begins with the development of a robust European model using the LUCAS Soil dataset and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to estimate key soil properties, including phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, and pH levels. This model is then enhanced by integrating supplementary features, such as weather data, harvest rates, and Clay AI-generated embeddings. This report details the methodological framework, data preprocessing strategies, and ML pipelines employed in this project. Advanced algorithms, including Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), were implemented and finetuned for precise nutrient prediction. Results showcase robust model performance, with root mean square error values meeting stringent accuracy thresholds. By establishing a reproducible and scalable pipeline for soil nutrient prediction, this research paves the way for transformative agricultural applications, including precision fertilization and improved resource allocation in underresourced regions like Africa.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report is the documentation of a student project collaboration between Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt and MI4People</p></details> |

Traditional process-based (PB) models are limited by fixed input features and struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized for being ``black boxes'' with limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we used Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), which combined the strengths of both approaches and fully used RS data. However, previous KGML methods overlooked the crucial role of soil moisture in plant growth. To bridge this gap, we proposed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, using soil moisture as an intermediate variable to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalizes predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other ML models. Finally, we explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction, assessing the importance of various features and analyzing how soil moisture impacts corn yield predictions across different regions and time periods.</p></details> |  |

Our model employs attention mechanisms operating across both features and data batches, enhanced by feature embedding layers that project inputs into higher-dimensional spaces. We implements Particle Swarm Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, systematically optimizing embedding dimensions, attention heads, and neural network architecture. The proposed architecture achieves superior predictive performance (Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 0.63%) compared to recent state of the art models for tabular data. Crucially, our model maintains explainability through SHapley Additive exPlanations value analysis, revealing that fine particle content and dry density are the most influential parameters affecting soil resistivity. We developes a web-based application implementing this model to provide engineers with an accessible decision support framework that bridges geotechnical and electrical engineering requirements for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. This integrated approach satisfies both structural stability and electrical safety standards, improving construction efficiency and safety compliance in high-voltage infrastructure implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.15827 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[BS-Mamba for Black-Soil Area Detection On the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12495v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extremely degraded grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) presents a significant environmental challenge due to overgrazing, climate change, and rodent activity, which degrade vegetation cover and soil quality. These extremely degraded grassland on QTP, commonly referred to as black-soil area, require accurate assessment to guide effective restoration efforts. In this paper, we present a newly created QTP black-soil dataset, annotated under expert guidance. We introduce a novel neural network model, BS-Mamba, specifically designed for the black-soil area detection using UAV remote sensing imagery. The BS-Mamba model demonstrates higher accuracy in identifying black-soil area across two independent test datasets than the state-of-the-art models. This research contributes to grassland restoration by providing an efficient method for assessing the extent of black-soil area on the QTP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Applied Remote Sensing, 2025</p></details> |

The semi-implicit formulation has two advantages compared with the explicit approach: the time step is independent of the water phase, and the pore pressure field is more stable. The semi-implicit MPM models based on the incremental fractional-step method available in the literature consist of modelling the soil and water mixture using a single set of material points only, in order to save computational time. In this study, we further derive this formulation with two sets of material points to represent the soil and water phases separately. The stress oscillations that are frequently found in the water and soil phases are stabilised with this approach. A new stabilisation method is developed based on the modified F-bar method. The proposed method is validated with two numerical examples under small and large deformations, respectively. After that, Nor-Sand constitutive soil model is used to simulate landslides. Numerical examples show an excellent performance of the proposed coupled MPM and the stabilisation method. The formulation with two sets of material points yields significantly different but more reliable results in the landslides analysis, compared with the single-point approach. Additionally, this research shows that the additional computational cost caused by the additional water material points is acceptable. Therefore, it is recommended to use two sets of material points for certain large deformation geotechnical problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LimeSoDa: A Dataset Collection for Benchmarking of Machine Learning Regressors in Digital Soil Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20139v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital soil mapping (DSM) relies on a broad pool of statistical methods, yet determining the optimal method for a given context remains challenging and contentious. Benchmarking studies on multiple datasets are needed to reveal strengths and limitations of commonly used methods. Existing DSM studies usually rely on a single dataset with restricted access, leading to incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. To address these issues, we introduce an open-access dataset collection called Precision Liming Soil Datasets (LimeSoDa). LimeSoDa consists of 31 field- and farm-scale datasets from various countries. Each dataset has three target soil properties: (1) soil organic matter or soil organic carbon, (2) clay content and (3) pH, alongside a set of features. Features are dataset-specific and were obtained by optical spectroscopy, proximal- and remote soil sensing. All datasets were aligned to a tabular format and are ready-to-use for modeling. We demonstrated the use of LimeSoDa for benchmarking by comparing the predictive performance of four learning algorithms across all datasets. This comparison included multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), categorical boosting (CatBoost) and random forest (RF). The results showed that although no single algorithm was universally superior, certain algorithms performed better in specific contexts. MLR and SVR performed better on high-dimensional spectral datasets, likely due to better compatibility with principal components. In contrast, CatBoost and RF exhibited considerably better performances when applied to datasets with a moderate number (< 20) of features. These benchmarking results illustrate that the performance of a method is highly context-dependent. LimeSoDa therefore provides an important resource for improving the development and evaluation of statistical methods in DSM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiclass Post-Earthquake Building Assessment Integrating Optical and SAR Satellite Imagery, Ground Motion, and Soil Data with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04664v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 12 Figures |
| **[Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) for Improving Accuracy of Model Prediction and Scientific Understanding of Soil Organic Carbon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00672v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes. However, retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data remains a challenge. Here, we develop a Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) that seamlessly integrates a vectorized process-based soil carbon cycle model (i.e., Community Land Model version 5, CLM5) into a neural network (NN) structure to examine mechanisms governing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage from big data. BINN demonstrates high accuracy in retrieving biogeochemical parameter values from synthetic data in a parameter recovery experiment. We use BINN to predict six major processes regulating the soil carbon cycle (or components in process-based models) from 25,925 observed SOC profiles across the conterminous US and compared them with the same processes previously retrieved by a Bayesian inference-based PROcess-guided deep learning and DAta-driven modeling (PRODA) approach (Tao et al. 2020; 2023). The high agreement between the spatial patterns of the retrieved processes using the two approaches with an average correlation coefficient of 0.81 confirms BINN's ability in retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data. Additionally, the integration of neural networks and process-based models in BINN improves computational efficiency by more than 50 times over PRODA. We conclude that BINN is a transformative tool that harnesses the power of both AI and process-based modeling, facilitating new scientific discoveries while improving interpretability and accuracy of Earth system models.</p></details> | 60 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Transient Instability and Patterns of Reactivity in Diffusive-Chemotaxis Soil Carbon Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08757v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern formation in diffusive-chemotaxis models has become increasingly important for understanding spatial structures in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. In soil, certain bacteria involved in the degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) exhibit both motility and chemotactic behavior, as observed in experiments and field studies. To capture the formation of hot-spot soil aggregations resulting from bacterial and microorganism spatial organization, the spatially explicit MOMOS model incorporates chemotaxis into soil carbon dynamics, effectively describing the emergence of microbial aggregations and their impact on SOC dynamics. While classical studies on pattern formation primarily rely on asymptotic stability analysis, transient instability has emerged as a key mechanism for generating patterns in asymptotically stable systems. In this work, we investigate pattern formation outside the classical diffusive-chemotaxis-driven instability conditions by focusing on regions of parameter space associated with reactive equilibria. The MOMOS model for soil carbon dynamics serves as a case study to illustrate how transient behaviors can influence environmental dynamical systems. Using Klika's indicator, we estimate the maximum amplification and show that it provides a more accurate lower bound compared to the Kreiss constant. Furthermore, we explore the critical role of return time, showing that short return times suppress the emergence of stable reactive patterns. By employing the determinant of the linearized Jacobian as a proxy for return time, we identify a critical region near the instability boundary where multiple stable reactive patterns emerge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Gradient Boosting Algorithms for Estimating Strength of Modified Subgrade Soil](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04826v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of pavement under loading depends on the strength of the subgrade. However, experimental estimation of properties of pavement strengths such as California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and resistance value (R) are often tedious, time-consuming and costly, thereby inspiring a growing interest in machine learning based tools which are simple, cheap and fast alternatives. Thus, the potential application of two boosting techniques; categorical boosting (CatBoost) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR), is similarly explored in this study for estimation of properties of subgrade soil modified with hydrated lime activated rice husk ash (HARSH). Using 121 experimental data samples of varying proportions of HARSH, plastic limit, liquid limit, plasticity index, clay activity, optimum moisture content, and maximum dry density as input for CBR, UCS and R estimation, four evaluation metrics namely coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the models' performance. The results indicate that XGBoost outperformed CatBoost and SVR in estimating these properties, yielding R2 of 0.9994, 0.9995 and 0.9999 in estimating the CBR, UCS and R respectively. Also, SVR outperformed CatBoost in estimating the CBR and R with R2 of 0.9997 respectively. On the other hand, CatBoost outperformed SVR in estimating the UCS with R2 of 0.9994. Feature sensitivity analysis shows that the three machine learning techniques are unanimous that increasing HARSH proportion lead to values of the estimated properties respectively. A comparison with previous results also shows superiority of XGBoost in estimating subgrade properties.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Key markers of these changes can be linked to the dynamic of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and related quantities, such as Soil Moisture (SM), Above Ground Biomass (AGB), and Freeze-Thaw (FT) Dynamics. These variables are crucial for understanding global climate changes, hydrological and carbon cycles included. Monitoring these variables helps to validate climate models and inform policy decisions. Technologies like microwave remote sensing provide critical tools for monitoring the effects of human activities on these variables at a global scale. Other than proper tachenological developments, the study of ECVs requires suitable theoretical retrieval tools, which leads to the solutions of inverse problems. In this brief survey, we analyze and summarize the main retrieval techniques available in the literature for SM, AGB, and FT, performed on data collected with microwave remote sensing sensors. Such methods will be some of the fundamental algorithms that can find applications in the research activities of the interdisciplinary, curiosity-driven, project {\it REmote sensing daTa INversion with multivariate functional modeling for essential climAte variables characterization (RETINA)}, recently funded by the European Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU, under the Italian Ministry of University and Research.

Current digital microscopic imagers and spectrometers used for astrobiological examination suffer from limitations such as insufficient resolution, narrow detection range, and lack of portability. To overcome these challenges, this research study presents modifications to the Phoenix rover to expand its capability for detecting biosignatures on Mars. This paper examines the modifications implemented on the Phoenix rover to enhance its capability to detect a broader spectrum of biosignatures. One of the notable improvements comprises the integration of advanced digital microscopic imagers and spectrometers, enabling high-resolution examination of soil samples. Additionally, the mechanical components of the device have been reinforced to enhance maneuverability and optimize subsurface sampling capabilities. Empirical investigations have demonstrated that Phoenix has the capability to navigate diverse geological environments and procure samples for the purpose of biomolecular analysis.

| **[Enabling Adoption of Regenerative Agriculture through Soil Carbon Copilots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16872v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize environ mental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.</p></details> |  |

In preparation for the launch of this constellation, we have developed a generalized deep learning retrieval pipeline, which now produces operational GNSS-R near-surface soil moisture retrievals using data from NASA's Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. In this article, we describe the input datasets, preprocessing methods, model architecture, development methods, and detail the soil moisture products generated from these retrievals. The performance of this product is quantified against in situ measurements and compared to both the target dataset (retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) satellite) and the v1.0 soil moisture product from the CYGNSS mission. The Muon Space product achieves improvements in spatial resolution over SMAP with comparable performance in many regions. An ubRMSE of 0.032 cm$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ for in situ soil moisture observations from SMAP core validation sites is shown, though performance is lower than SMAP's when comparing in forests and/or mountainous terrain. The Muon Space product outperforms the v1.0 CYGNSS soil moisture product in almost all aspects. This initial release serves as the foundation of our operational soil moisture product, which soon will additionally include data from Muon Space satellites.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |

To increase crop productivity, soil require some specific characteristics. For watermelon cultivation, soil needs to be sandy and of high temperature with proper irrigation. This research aims to design and implement an intelligent IoT-based soil characterization system for the watermelon field to measure the soil characteristics. IoT based developed system measures moisture, temperature, and pH of soil using different sensors, and the sensor data is uploaded to the cloud via Arduino and Raspberry Pi, from where users can obtain the data using mobile application and webpage developed for this system. To ensure the precision of the framework, this study includes the comparison between the readings of the soil parameters by the existing field soil meters, the values obtained from the sensors integrated IoT system, and data obtained from soil science laboratory.

Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics. The Bi-LSTM model effectively predicts contaminant concentrations for the next four years, demonstrating the potential of advanced time series analysis to improve MNA strategies and reduce reliance on manual groundwater sampling. The code, along with its usage instructions, validation, and requirements, is available at: https://github.com/csplevuanh/pylenm_extension.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper will be withdrawn to fix some work issues with the sections on Bi-LSTM models</p></details> |

The experiment, known as the Millenium Tillage Trial (MTT), ran on 42 field-plots for ten years from 2000-2010; here CQUESST is used to model soil carbon dynamically in six pools, in each of the 42 agricultural plots, and on a monthly time step for a decade. We show how CQUESST can be used to estimate soil-carbon cycling rates under different treatments. Our methods provide much-needed statistical tools for quantitatively inferring the effectiveness of different experimental treatments on soil-carbon sequestration. The decade-long data are of multiple observation types, and these interacting time series are ingested into a fully Bayesian model that has a dynamic stochastic model of multiple pools of soil carbon at its core. CQUESST's stochastic model is motivated by the deterministic RothC soil-carbon model based on nonlinear difference equations. We demonstrate how CQUESST can estimate soil-carbon fluxes for different experimental treatments while acknowledging uncertainties in soil-carbon dynamics, in physical parameters, and in observations. CQUESST is implemented efficiently in the probabilistic programming language Stan using its MapReduce parallelization, and it scales well for large numbers of field-plots, using software libraries that allow for computation to be shared over multiple nodes of high-performance computing clusters.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a systematic, data-driven approach, we demonstrate that transformers have significantly outperformed conventional deep learning and machine learning methods since 2022, achieving prediction performance between 92% and 97%. The review is specifically focused on soil analysis, due to the importance of soil condition in optimizing crop productivity and ensuring sustainable farming practices. Transformer-based models have shown remarkable capabilities in handling complex multivariate soil data, improving the accuracy of soil moisture prediction, soil element analysis, and other soil-related applications. This systematic review primarily focuses on 1) analysing research trends and patterns in the literature, both chronologically and technically, and 2) conducting a comparative analysis of data fusion approaches, considering factors such as data types, techniques, and RS applications.

The impact of a given management change on the SOC content of a given volume of soil is generally unknown, but is likely moderated by features of the land that collectively determine its sequestration potential. To maximize sequestration, management interventions should be preferentially applied to fields with the highest sequestration potential and the lowest cost of application. We present a design-based statistical framework for estimating sequestration potential, average treatment effects, and optimal management policies from a randomized experiment with baseline covariate information. We review the myriad and nested sources of uncertainty that arise in this context and formalize the problem using potential outcomes. We show that a particular regression estimator -- regressing field-level SOC on management indicators and their interactions with covariates -- can help identify effective policies. The regression estimator also gives asymptotically valid inference on average treatment effects under the randomized design -- without modeling assumptions -- and can increase precision and power compared to the difference-in-means $T$-test. We conclude by discussing the saturation hypothesis in relation to sequestration potential, other study designs including observational studies of SOC, models for policy costs, nonparametric inference, and broader policy uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A total of 1,133 soil samples from diverse agro-climatic zones in Eastern India were analyzed. The research integrated color and texture features from microscopic soil images, PXRF data, and auxiliary soil variables (AVs) using a Random Forest model. Results showed that combining image features (IFs) with AVs significantly improved prediction accuracy for available B (R2 = 0.80) and OC (R2 = 0.88). A data fusion approach, incorporating IFs, AVs, and PXRF data, further enhanced predictions for available Mn and SAI, with R2 values of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. The study highlights the potential of integrating these technologies to offer rapid, cost-effective soil testing methods, paving the way for more advanced predictive models and a deeper understanding of soil fertility. Future work should explore the application of deep learning models on a larger dataset, incorporating soils from a wider range of agro-climatic zones under field conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 'Soil Advances'</p></details> |

It is common to utilize statistical and machine learning models to estimate soil moisture from traditional data sources such as weather forecasts, soil properties, and crop properties. However, there is a growing interest in utilizing aerial and geospatial imagery to estimate soil moisture. Although these images capture high-resolution crop details, they are expensive to curate and challenging to interpret. Imagine, an AI-enhanced software tool that predicts soil moisture using visual cues captured by smartphones and statistical data given by weather forecasts. This work is a first step towards that goal of developing a multi-modal approach for soil moisture estimation. In particular, we curate a dataset consisting of real-world images taken from ground stations and their corresponding weather data. We also propose MIS-ME - Meteorological & Image based Soil Moisture Estimator, a multi-modal framework for soil moisture estimation. Our extensive analysis shows that MIS-ME achieves a MAPE of 10.14%, outperforming traditional unimodal approaches with a reduction of 3.25% in MAPE for meteorological data and 2.15% in MAPE for image data, highlighting the effectiveness of tailored multi-modal approaches.

Soil moisture measurement technique of the proposed sensor is based on the complex permittivity sensing property of a DPS in time domain. Soil relative permittivity which varies with its moisture content is measured by burying the DPS under a soil mass and changing its phase difference while excited with a 114 MHz sine wave (single tone). DPS output phase and magnitude are compared with the reference signal and measured with a phase/loss detector. The proposed sensor exhibits accuracy better than +-1.2 percent at the highest Volumetric Water Content (VWC=30 percent) for sandy-type soil. Precise design guide is developed and simulations are performed to achieve a highly sensitive sensor. The measurement results validate the accuracy of theoretical analysis and design procedure. Owning the advantages of low profile, low power consumption, and high sensitivity makes the proposed TDT-SMS a good candidate for precision farming and IoT systems.</p></details> |  |

Precise mapping of SOC distribution is imperative for the quantification of ecosystem services, notably carbon sequestration and soil fertility enhancement. Digital soil mapping (DSM) leverages statistical models and advanced technologies, including machine learning (ML), to accurately map soil properties, such as SOC, utilizing diverse data sources like satellite imagery, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate series. Within the domain of ML, self-supervised learning (SSL), which exploits unlabeled data, has gained prominence in recent years. This study introduces a novel approach that aims to learn the geographical link between multimodal features via self-supervised contrastive learning, employing pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) for image inputs and Transformers for climate data, before fine-tuning the model with ground reference samples. The proposed approach has undergone rigorous testing on two distinct large-scale datasets, with results indicating its superiority over traditional supervised learning models, which depends solely on labeled data. Furthermore, through the utilization of various evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, CCC, etc.), the proposed model exhibits higher accuracy when compared to other conventional ML algorithms like random forest and gradient boosting. This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and contributes to the advancement of DSM techniques, thereby facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)</p></details> |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |

The typical modelling process requires the soil moisture time series to be manually separated into drydown segments and then exponential decay models are fitted to them independently. Sensor development over recent years means that experiments that were previously conducted over a few field campaigns can now be scaled to months or years at a higher sampling rate. To better meet the challenge of increasing data size, this paper proposes a novel changepoint-based approach to automatically identify structural changes in the soil drying process and simultaneously estimate the drydown parameters that are of interest to soil scientists. A simulation study is carried out to demonstrate the performance of the method in detecting changes and retrieving model parameters. Practical aspects of the method such as adding covariates and penalty learning are discussed. The method is applied to hourly soil moisture time series from the NEON data portal to investigate the temporal dynamics of soil moisture drydown. We recover known relationships previously identified manually, alongside delivering new insights into the temporal variability across soil types and locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages for the main manuscript, 8 pages for the supplemental document</p></details> |

In this paper, we focus on two reaction-diffusion chemotaxis models for SOC dynamics, both supporting chemotaxis-driven instability and exhibiting a variety of spatial patterns as stripes, spots and hexagons when the microbial chemotactic sensitivity is above a critical threshold. We use symplectic techniques to numerically approximate chemotaxis-driven spatial patterns and explore the effectiveness of the piecewice dynamic mode decomposition (pDMD) to reconstruct them. Our findings show that pDMD is effective at precisely recreating chemotaxis-driven spatial patterns, therefore broadening the range of application of the method to classes of solutions different than Turing patterns. By validating its efficacy across a wider range of models, this research lays the groundwork for applying pDMD to experimental spatiotemporal data, advancing predictions crucial for soil microbial ecology and agricultural sustainability.</p></details> |  |

Different from the state-of-the-art method, we model the soil microbial community as an ecological co-occurrence network with the taxa as nodes (weighted by their abundance) and their relationships (a combination from both spatial and functional ecological aspects) as edges (weighted by the strength of the relationships). Then, we design a method called gFlora which notably uses graph convolution over this co-occurrence network to get the co-response effect of the group, such that the network topology is also considered in the discovery process. We evaluate gFlora on two real-world soil microbiome datasets (bacteria and nematodes) and compare it with the state-of-the-art method. gFlora outperforms this on all evaluation metrics, and discovers new functional evidence for taxa which were so far under-studied. We show that the graph convolution step is crucial to taxa with relatively low abundance (thus removing the bias towards taxa with higher abundance), and the discovered bacteria of different genera are distributed in the co-occurrence network but still tightly connected among themselves, demonstrating that topologically they fill different but collaborative functional roles in the ecological community.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIOKD...</summary><p>BIOKDD accepted.

Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying vegetation and surface organic material, making its characterization challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire risk assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict moisture contents and depths of soil and overlaying material layer. Due to its high correlation with moisture contents, the dielectric permittivity of both layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values, depth of the overlaying surface layer, and coarseness of its material. The field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The depth of the surface layer could also be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The proposed method provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware sub-surface parameter estimation that can enable decision-making for risk assessment across a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Total...</summary><p>Total 34 pages, 17 Figures.

The method employs a valuated graph of connected voxels to simulate transformation and diffusion processes involved in microbial decomposition within the complex soil matrix. The resulting model can be adapted to simulate any diffusion-transformation processes in porous media. We implemented parallelization strategies and explored different numerical methods, including implicit, explicit, synchronous, and asynchronous schemes. To validate our method, we compared simulation outputs with those provided by LBioS and by Mosaic models. LBioS uses a lattice-Boltzmann method for diffusion and Mosaic takes benefit of Pore Network Geometrical Modelling (PNGM) by means of geometrical primitives such as spheres and ellipsoids. This approach achieved comparable results to traditional LBM-based simulations, but required only one-fourth of the computing time. Compared to Mosaic simulation, the proposed method is slower but more accurate and does not require any calibration. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework and an application example to enhance PNGM-based simulations. This is accomplished by approximating the diffusional conductance coefficients using stochastic gradient descent and data generated by the current approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

To address this, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra based on soil property inputs was developed. The model is trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property pairs from 17 datasets. It generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format. The generative model can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties. SOGM is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the full visible-near-infrared range (VIS-NIR; 400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM. The SOGM was up-scaled by coupling with the Helios 3D plant modeling software, which allowed for generation of synthetic aerial images of simulated soil and plant scenes. It can also be easily integrated with soil-plant radiation model used for remote sensin research like PROSAIL. The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets that not included in model training proved that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs. The presented models are openly accessible on: https://github.com/GEMINI-Breeding/SOGM_soil_spectra_simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted to Remote sensing of Environment and revised</p></details> |

When combined with Machine-Learning-based (ML) methods, high-resolution Stepped Frequency Countinuous Wave Radar (SFCW) measurements hold the promise to give cost effective access to depth resolved soil parameters, including at root-level depth. In a first step in this direction, we perform an extensive field survey with a tractor mounted SFCW GPR instrument. Using ML data processing we test the GPR instrument's capabilities to predict the apparent electrical conductivity (ECaR) as measured by a simultaneously recording Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) instrument. The large-scale field measurement campaign with 3472 co-registered and geo-located GPR and EMI data samples distributed over ~6600 square meters was performed on a golf course. The selected terrain benefits from a high surface homogeneity, but also features the challenge of only small, and hence hard to discern, variations in the measured soil parameter. Based on the quantitative results we suggest the use of nugget-to-sill ratio as a performance metric for the evaluation of end-to-end ML performance in the agricultural setting and discuss the limiting factors in the multi-sensor regression setting. The code is released as open source and available at https://opensource.silicon-austria.com/xuc/soil-analysis-machine-learning-stepped-frequency-gpr.</p></details> |  |

The Richards equation and different formulations are used in the developed numerical model to describe infiltration in root zone and to investigate the impact of the plant root on the distribution of soil moisture. The Kirchhoff transformed Richards equation is used and the Gardner model is considered for capillary pressure. In our approach, we employ a meshless method based on localized radial basis functions (LRBF) to solve the resulting system of equations. The LRBF approach is an accurate and computationally efficient method that does not require mesh generation and is flexible in addressing high-dimensional problems with complex geometries. Furthermore, this method leads to a sparse matrix system, which avoids ill-conditioning issues. We implement the coupled numerical model of infiltration and plant root water uptake for one, two, and three-dimensional soils. Numerical experiments are performed using nontrivial analytical solutions and available experimental data to validate the coupled numerical model. The numerical results demonstrate the performance and ability of the proposed numerical method to predict soil moisture dynamics in root zone.</p></details> |  |

It has been recently shown that detrimental effects the PSNF has on the growth of plant's biomass can be mitigated by periodically intervening on the plant/soil system, for example by washing the soil. The periodic control inputs were computed by using an average model of the system and then applied in open-loop. In this paper we present two feedback control strategies, namely a PI and a MPC-based controllers, that, by adapting online the duty-cycle of the periodic control input, guarantee precise regulation of the biomass yield and at the same time robustness to unavoidable modeling errors and perturbations acting on the system. The performance of the proposed control strategies is then validated by means of extensive numerical simulations.</p></details> | Accepted to ECC 2024 |

We introduce a numerical approach that combines the localized exponential radial basis function (EXP-RBF) method for space and the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) for temporal discretization. The localized RBF methods eliminate the need for mesh generation and avoid ill-conditioning problems. This approach yields a sparse matrix for the global system, optimizing memory usage and computational time. The proposed implicit EXP-RBF techniques have advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency thanks to the use of BDF2 and the localized RBF method. Modified Picards iteration method for the mixed form of the Richards equation is employed to linearize the system. Various numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed numerical model of infiltration with plant root water absorption. The obtained results conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical model in accurately predicting soil moisture dynamics under water uptake by plant roots. The proposed numerical techniques can be incorporated in the numerical models where unsaturated flows and water uptake by plant roots are involved such as in hydrology, agriculture, and water management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Upscaling of Point-scale Soil Moisture Measurements for Spatial Evaluation of Model Simulations and Satellite Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05229v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of modelled or satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) estimates is usually dependent on comparisons against in-situ SM measurements. However, the inherent mismatch in spatial support (i.e., scale) necessitates a cautious interpretation of point-to-pixel comparisons. The upscaling of the in-situ measurements to a commensurate resolution to that of the modelled or retrieved SM will lead to a fairer comparison and statistically more defensible evaluation. In this study, we presented an upscaling approach that combines spatiotemporal fusion with machine learning to extrapolate point-scale SM measurements from 28 in-situ sites to a 100 m resolution for an agricultural area of 100 km by 100 km. We conducted a four-fold cross-validation, which consistently demonstrated comparable correlation performance across folds, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. The proposed approach was further validated based on a cross-cluster strategy by using two spatial subsets within the study area, denoted as cluster A and B, each of which equally comprised of 12 in-situ sites. The cross-cluster validation underscored the capability of the upscaling approach to map the spatial variability of SM within areas that were not covered by in-situ sites, with correlation performance ranging between 0.6 and 0.8. In general, our proposed upscaling approach offers an avenue to extrapolate point measurements of SM to a spatial scale more akin to climatic model grids or remotely sensed observations. Future investigations should delve into a further evaluation of the upscaling approach using independent data, such as model simulations, satellite retrievals or field campaign data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and selected as the Student Paper Competition finalists at the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Performance triggered adaptive model reduction for soil moisture estimation in precision irrigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01468v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate soil moisture information is crucial for developing precise irrigation control strategies to enhance water use efficiency. Soil moisture estimation based on limited soil moisture sensors is crucial for obtaining comprehensive soil moisture information when dealing with large-scale agricultural fields. The major challenge in soil moisture estimation lies in the high dimensionality of the spatially discretized agro-hydrological models. In this work, we propose a performance-triggered adaptive model reduction approach to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a trajectory-based unsupervised machine learning technique, and a prediction performance-based triggering scheme is designed to govern model updates adaptively in a way such that the prediction error between the reduced model and the original model over a prediction horizon is maintained below a predetermined threshold. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed based on the reduced model for soil moisture estimation. The applicability and performance of the proposed approach are evaluated extensively through the application to a simulated large-scale agricultural field.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Machine Learning Approach for Crop Yield and Disease Prediction Integrating Soil Nutrition and Weather Factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19273v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of an intelligent agricultural decision-supporting system for crop selection and disease forecasting in Bangladesh is the main objective of this work. The economy of the nation depends heavily on agriculture. However, choosing crops with better production rates and efficiently controlling crop disease are obstacles that farmers have to face. These issues are addressed in this research by utilizing machine learning methods and real-world datasets. The recommended approach uses a variety of datasets on the production of crops, soil conditions, agro-meteorological regions, crop disease, and meteorological factors. These datasets offer insightful information on disease trends, soil nutrition demand of crops, and agricultural production history. By incorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily selected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then the predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used to forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by utilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use of the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a final crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the outcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as prevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions. Consequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers can predict possible crop yields. Overall, by offering a detailed decision support system for crop selection and disease prediction, this work can play a vital role in advancing agricultural practices in Bangladesh.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented to the IEEE conference, "2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Electrical, and Smart Systems (iCACCESS), 8-9 March, Dhaka, Bangladesh"</p></details> |
| **[GloSIS: The Global Soil Information System Web Ontology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16778v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Established in 2012 by members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) is a global network of stakeholders promoting sound land and soil management practices towards a sustainable world food system. However, soil survey largely remains a local or regional activity, bound to heterogeneous methods and conventions. Recognising the relevance of global and trans-national policies towards sustainable land management practices, the GSP elected data harmonisation and exchange as one of its key lines of action. Building upon international standards and previous work towards a global soil data ontology, an improved domain model was eventually developed within the GSP [54], the basis for a Global Soil Information System (GloSIS). This work also identified the Semantic Web as a possible avenue to operationalise the domain model. This article presents the GloSIS web ontology, an implementation of the GloSIS domain model with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Thoroughly employing a host of Semantic Web standards (SOSA, SKOS, GeoSPARQL, QUDT), GloSIS lays out not only a soil data ontology but also an extensive set of ready-to-use code-lists for soil description and physio-chemical analysis. Various examples are provided on the provision and use of GloSIS-compliant linked data, showcasing the contribution of this ontology to the discovery, exploration, integration and access of soil data.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Effect of Different Optimization Strategies to Physics-Constrained Deep Learning for Soil Moisture Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08154v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soil moisture is a key hydrological parameter that has significant importance to human society and the environment. Accurate modeling and monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields, especially in the root zone (top 100 cm of soil), is essential for improving agricultural production and crop yield with the help of precision irrigation and farming tools. Realizing the full sensor data potential depends greatly on advanced analytical and predictive domain-aware models. In this work, we propose a physics-constrained deep learning (P-DL) framework to integrate physics-based principles on water transport and water sensing signals for effective reconstruction of the soil moisture dynamics. We adopt three different optimizers, namely Adam, RMSprop, and GD, to minimize the loss function of P-DL during the training process. In the illustrative case study, we demonstrate the empirical convergence of Adam optimizers outperforms the other optimization methods in both mini-batch and full-batch training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance of Expansive Soil Stabilized with Bamboo Charcoal, Quarry Dust, and Lime for Use as Road Subgrade Material](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06669v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expansive soils such as Black Cotton Soils (BCS) present significant challenges for road subgrade construction due to their high plasticity, swelling potential, and low strength. This study explores a triphasic stabilization method using Bamboo Charcoal (BC), Quarry Dust (QD), and Lime (L) to enhance the engineering properties of BCS for rural road applications. Initial soil characterization involved standard tests, including Atterberg limits, compaction, and Californian Bearing Ratio (CBR) assessments. The soil was treated with varying BC proportions (5% to 35% at 5% intervals) in the initial phase, leading to a progressive reduction in the Plasticity Index (PI) and swell index and an enhancement in the CBR up to 20% BC content. This further resulted in a soaked CBR value of 2.7%. In the second phase, additional treatment combined with BC and QD, incorporating diverse QD proportions (4% to 24%) relative to the optimal BC content. This further improved the CBR to 7.7% at 12% QD, but the PI exhibited a non-linear trend. Finally, 5% lime was introduced in the final phase. This minimized the PI to 11.2% and significantly increased the CBR to 19%. The optimal combination of 20% BC, 12% QD, and 5% Lime achieved optimal plasticity, compaction, and strength characteristics, demonstrating the viability of this approach for transforming BCS into a sustainable and cost-effective alternative for rural road subgrade construction.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 images |
| **[A bivariate spatial extreme mixture model for unreplicated heavy metal soil contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14624v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geostatistical models for multivariate applications such as heavy metal soil contamination work under Gaussian assumptions and may result in underestimated extreme values and misleading risk assessments (Marchant et al, 2011). A more suitable framework to analyse extreme values is extreme value theory (EVT). However, EVT relies on replications in time, which are generally not available in geochemical datasets. Therefore, using EVT to map soil contamination requires adaptation to be used in the usual single-replicate data framework of soil surveys. We propose a bivariate spatial extreme mixture model to model the body and tail of contaminant pairs, where the tails are described using a stationary generalised Pareto distribution. We demonstrate the performance of our model using a simulation study and through modelling bivariate soil contamination in the Glasgow conurbation. Model results are given as maps of predicted marginal concentrations and probabilities of joint exceedance of soil guideline values. Marginal concentration maps show areas of elevated lead levels along the Clyde River and elevated levels of chromium around the south and southeast villages such as East Kilbride and Wishaw. The joint probability maps show higher probabilities of joint exceedance to the south and southeast of the city centre, following known legacy contamination regions in the Clyde River basin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Limits in Machine Learning: Prediction of Plant Phenotypes Using Soil Microbiome Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11157v2)** | 2024-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The preservation of soil health is a critical challenge in the 21st century due to its significant impact on agriculture, human health, and biodiversity. We provide the first deep investigation of the predictive potential of machine learning models to understand the connections between soil and biological phenotypes. We investigate an integrative framework performing accurate machine learning-based prediction of plant phenotypes from biological, chemical, and physical properties of the soil via two models: random forest and Bayesian neural network. We show that prediction is improved when incorporating environmental features like soil physicochemical properties and microbial population density into the models, in addition to the microbiome information. Exploring various data preprocessing strategies confirms the significant impact of human decisions on predictive performance. We show that the naive total sum scaling normalization that is commonly used in microbiome research is not the optimal strategy to maximize predictive power. Also, we find that accurately defined labels are more important than normalization, taxonomic level or model characteristics. In cases where humans are unable to classify samples accurately, machine learning model performance is limited. Lastly, we provide domain scientists via a full model selection decision tree to identify the human choices that optimize model prediction power. Our work is accompanied by open source reproducible scripts (https://github.com/solislemuslab/soil-microbiome-nn) for maximum outreach among the microbiome research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Innovative Approaches in Soil Carbon Sequestration Modelling for Better Prediction with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04789v3)** | 2024-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soil carbon accounting and prediction play a key role in building decision support systems for land managers selling carbon credits, in the spirit of the Paris and Kyoto protocol agreements. Land managers typically rely on computationally complex models fit using sparse datasets to make these accounts and predictions. The model complexity and sparsity of the data can lead to over-fitting, leading to inaccurate results when making predictions with new data. Modellers address over-fitting by simplifying their models and reducing the number of parameters, and in the current context this could involve neglecting some soil organic carbon (SOC) components. In this study, we introduce two novel SOC models and a new RothC-like model and investigate how the SOC components and complexity of the SOC models affect the SOC prediction in the presence of small and sparse time series data. We develop model selection methods that can identify the soil carbon model with the best predictive performance, in light of the available data. Through this analysis we reveal that commonly used complex soil carbon models can over-fit in the presence of sparse time series data, and our simpler models can produce more accurate predictions. The published version of this study is available in Scientific Reports (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53516-z/<10.1038/s41598-024-53516-z>)</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |

The study included monitoring of radon concentration, pressure field extension (pfe) under the slab and some atmospheric parameters for different testing phases. Periods in which the house remained closed to foster radon accumulation were alternated with phases of active and passive soil depressurisation under different conditions. The behaviour of the radon concentration in the pilot house was analysed along with the influence of atmospheric variables, significant correlations were found for the radon concentration with atmospheric pressure, outdoor temperature and wind. From the pfe analysis it was proven that the pressure drop with distance from the suction point of the SD system is proportional to the depressurisation generated. It was found also that the permeability characterisation of the pilot house agrees with the literature about granular fill materials characterisation for radon SD systems across Europe. Radon reductions in excess of 85% were achieved for the different testing phases in all cases. Finally, from the results it was stated that a fan power of 23 W is sufficient to ensure radon reductions over 85% for dwellings with similar aggregate layer and soil permeability.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While sensor-based soil information offers higher-fidelity and reliable insights into organic matter changes, sampling and measuring sensor data is cost-prohibitive. We propose a multi-modal, scalable framework that can estimate organic matter from remote sensing data, a more readily available data source while leveraging sparse soil information for improving generalization. Using the sensor data, we preserve underlying causal relations among sensor attributes and organic matter. Simultaneously we leverage inherent structure in the data and train the model to discriminate among domains using contrastive learning. This causal and contrastive constraint minimization ensures improved generalization and adaptation to other domains. We also shed light on the interpretability of the framework by identifying attributes that are important for improving generalization. Identifying these key soil attributes that affect organic matter will aid in efforts to standardize data collection efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips workshop on Tackling Climate Change 2023</p></details> |

The proposed strategy enables VPPs, acting as aggregators for inverter-based resources (IBRs), to provide optimal frequency support economically. The proposed strategy captures time-varying active power injections, reducing the unnecessary redundancy compared to traditional fixed reserve schemes. Reserve requirements for the VPPs are determined based on system frequency response and safety constraints, ensuring efficient grid support. Furthermore, an energy-based allocation model decomposes power injections for each IBR, accounting for their specific limitations. Numerical experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting significant financial gains for VPPs, especially as system inertia decreases due to higher renewable energy integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Applied Energy</p></details> |

| **[Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04936v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To establish a self-sustained human presence in space and to explore deeper into the solar system, extensive research has been conducted on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. Past studies have proposed and researched many technologies to produce oxygen from regolith, such as carbothermal reduction and water extraction from icy regolith, to utilize it for astronauts' life support and as the propellant of space systems. However, determining the most promising technology remains challenging due to uncertainties in the lunar environment and processing methods. To better understand the lunar environment and ISRU operations, it is crucial to gather more information. Motivated by this need for information gathering, this paper proposes a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two different hybrid plant architectures integrating both technologies (1) in parallel and (2) in series are examined. The former involves mining and processing in both a Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) and a peak of eternal light in parallel, while the latter solely mines in a PSR. In this series hybrid architecture, the dry regolith tailings from water extraction are further processed by carbothermal reduction. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of the landed mass and required power of each plant architecture utilizing subsystem-level models. Furthermore, based on uncertain parameters such as resource content in regolith, the potential performance range of each plant was discovered through Monte Carlo simulations. The result indicates the benefit of the series hybrid architecture in terms of regolith excavation rate, while its mass cost seems the highest among the studied architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables, accepted by Acta Astronautica</p></details> |

Smart tools, especially VOC sensors, are crucial for monitoring indoor air quality, yet interpreting signals from various VOC sources remains challenging. A promising approach involves understanding how indoor plants respond to environmental conditions. Plants produce terpenes, a type of VOC, when exposed to abiotic and biotic stressors - including pathogens, predators, light, and temperature - offering a novel pathway for monitoring indoor air quality. While prior work often relies on specialized laboratory sensors, our research leverages readily available commercial sensors to detect and classify plant emitted VOCs that signify changes in indoor conditions. We quantified the sensitivity of these sensors by measuring 16 terpenes in controlled experiments, then identified and tested the most promising terpenes in realistic environments. We also examined physics based models to map VOC responses but found them lacking for real world complexity. Consequently, we trained machine learning models to classify terpenes using commercial sensors and identified optimal sensor placement. To validate this approach, we analyzed emissions from a living basil plant, successfully detecting terpene output. Our findings establish a foundation for overcoming challenges in plant VOC detection, paving the way for advanced plant based sensors to enhance indoor environmental quality in future smart buildings.</p></details> |  |

We examine the three standard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak recovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or alignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a predicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using the correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions. We then demonstrate that \emph{Diamond Percolation}, an algorithm based on common-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on edge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of communities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes follow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in real-world networks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first recovery results for such unbalanced partitions.</p></details> |  |

Validation across different thermal losses, optical efficiencies, and irradiance conditions-sunny, partially cloudy, and cloudy-show improved thermal power output and intercept factors compared to a no-allocation system. It demonstrates scalability and practicality for large solar thermal plants, enhancing overall performance. The method was first validated through simulations on a realistic solar plant model, then adapted and successfully tested in a 50 MW solar trough plant, demonstrating its advantages. Furthermore, the algorithms have been implemented, commissioned, and are currently operating in 13 commercial solar trough plants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Renewable Energy</p></details> |

However, existing generative models struggle to maintain object-level accuracy when translating images between domains, especially when domain gaps are significant. In this work, we introduce AGILE (Attention-Guided Image and Label Translation for Efficient Cross-Domain Plant Trait Identification), a diffusion-based framework that leverages optimized text embeddings and attention guidance to semantically constrain image translation. AGILE utilizes pretrained diffusion models and publicly available agricultural datasets to improve the fidelity of translated images while preserving critical object semantics. Our approach optimizes text embeddings to strengthen the correspondence between source and target images and guides attention maps during the denoising process to control object placement. We evaluate AGILE on cross-domain plant datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating semantically accurate translated images. Quantitative experiments show that AGILE enhances object detection performance in the target domain while maintaining realism and consistency. Compared to prior image translation methods, AGILE achieves superior semantic alignment, particularly in challenging cases where objects vary significantly or domain gaps are substantial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Based Thresholding for Reliable Anomaly Detection in Concentrated Solar Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19146v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and reliable operation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants is essential for meeting the growing demand for sustainable energy. However, high-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record infrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly score, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score on a validation set. This work proposes a framework for generating more reliable decision thresholds with finite-sample coverage guarantees on any chosen risk function. Our framework also incorporates an abstention mechanism, allowing high-risk predictions to be deferred to domain experts. Second, we propose a density forecasting method to estimate the likelihood of an observed image given a sequence of previously observed images, using this likelihood as its anomaly score. Third, we analyze the deployment results of our framework across multiple training scenarios over several months for two CSP plants. This analysis provides valuable insights to our industry partner for optimizing maintenance operations. Finally, given the confidential nature of our dataset, we provide an extended simulated dataset, leveraging recent advancements in generative modeling to create diverse thermal images that simulate multiple CSP plants. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19069v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However, prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises. Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges, maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$, with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far\textemdash{}and many more. Finally, we identify conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.</p></details> | 110 pages |

AI-driven automated classification has emerged as a promising solution, with deep learning models demonstrating impressive performance in plant disease identification. However, deploying these models on mobile and edge devices remains challenging due to high computational demands and resource constraints, highlighting the need for lightweight, accurate solutions for accessible smart agriculture systems. To address this, we propose MobilePlantViT, a novel hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture designed for generalized plant disease classification, which optimizes resource efficiency while maintaining high performance.

| **[The Fundamental Limits of Recovering Planted Subgraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15723v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an arbitrary subgraph $H=H_n$ and $p=p_n \in (0,1)$, the planted subgraph model is defined as follows. A statistician observes the union a random copy $H^*$ of $H$, together with random noise in the form of an instance of an Erdos-Renyi graph $G(n,p)$. Their goal is to recover the planted $H^*$ from the observed graph. Our focus in this work is to understand the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) for sufficiently large $n$. A recent paper [MNSSZ23] characterizes the graphs for which the limiting MMSE curve undergoes a sharp phase transition from $0$ to $1$ as $p$ increases, a behavior known as the all-or-nothing phenomenon, up to a mild density assumption on $H$. In this paper, we provide a formula for the limiting MMSE curve for any graph $H=H_n$, up to the same mild density assumption. This curve is expressed in terms of a variational formula over pairs of subgraphs of $H$, and is inspired by the celebrated subgraph expectation thresholds from the probabilistic combinatorics literature [KK07]. Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time description of the optimizers of this variational problem. This allows one to efficiently approximately compute the MMSE curve for any dense graph $H$ when $n$ is large enough. The proof relies on a novel graph decomposition of $H$ as well as a new minimax theorem which may be of independent interest. Our results generalize to the setting of minimax rates of recovering arbitrary monotone boolean properties planted in random noise, where the statistician observes the union of a planted minimal element $A \subseteq [N]$ of a monotone property and a random $Ber(p)^{\otimes N}$ vector. In this setting, we provide a variational formula inspired by the so-called "fractional" expectation threshold [Tal10], again describing the MMSE curve (in this case up to a multiplicative constant) for large enough $n$.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging for bushy plants like dwarf tomatoes due to their complex canopies. Traditional methods are often labor-intensive, damaging to plants, or limited in capturing canopy complexity. This study evaluated a non-destructive method combining sequential 3D reconstructions from RGB images and machine learning to estimate TLA for three dwarf tomato cultivars: Mohamed, Hahms Gelbe Topftomate, and Red Robin -- grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two experiments (spring-summer and autumn-winter) included 73 plants, yielding 418 TLA measurements via an "onion" approach. High-resolution videos were recorded, and 500 frames per plant were used for 3D reconstruction. Point clouds were processed using four algorithms (Alpha Shape, Marching Cubes, Poisson's, Ball Pivoting), and meshes were evaluated with seven regression models: Multivariable Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. The Alpha Shape reconstruction ($\alpha = 3$) with Extreme Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance ($R^2 = 0.80$, $MAE = 489 cm^2$). Cross-experiment validation showed robust results ($R^2 = 0.56$, $MAE = 579 cm^2$). Feature importance analysis identified height, width, and surface area as key predictors. This scalable, automated TLA estimation method is suited for urban farming and precision agriculture, offering applications in automated pruning, resource efficiency, and sustainable food production. The approach demonstrated robustness across variable environmental conditions and canopy structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **["All-Something-Nothing" Phase Transitions in Planted k-Factor Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08984v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of inferring a $k$-factor, specifically a spanning $k$-regular graph, planted within an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,\lambda/n)$. We uncover an interesting "all-something-nothing" phase transition. Specifically, we show that as the average degree $\lambda$ surpasses the critical threshold of $1/k$, the inference problem undergoes a transition from almost exact recovery ("all" phase) to partial recovery ("something" phase). Moreover, as $\lambda$ tends to infinity, the accuracy of recovery diminishes to zero, leading to the onset of the "nothing" phase. This finding complements the recent result by Mossel, Niles-Weed, Sohn, Sun, and Zadik who established that for certain sufficiently dense graphs, the problem undergoes an "all-or-nothing" phase transition, jumping from near-perfect to near-zero recovery. In addition, we characterize the recovery accuracy of a linear-time iterative pruning algorithm and show that it achieves almost exact recovery when $\lambda < 1/k$. A key component of our analysis is a two-step cycle construction: we first build trees through local neighborhood exploration and then connect them by sprinkling using reserved edges. Interestingly, for proving impossibility of almost exact recovery, we construct $\Theta(n)$ many small trees of size $\Theta(1)$, whereas for establishing the algorithmic lower bound, a single large tree of size $\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})$ suffices.</p></details> | 43 pages, 5 figures |

In order to handle such geolocation dependency, we propose \textit{Spatioformer}, where a novel geolocation encoder is coupled with the transformer model to encode geolocation context into remote sensing imagery. The Spatioformer model compares favourably to state-of-the-art models in richness predictions on a large-scale ground-truth richness dataset (HAVPlot) that consists of 68,170 in-situ richness samples covering diverse landscapes across Australia. The results demonstrate that geolocational information is advantageous in predicting species richness from satellite observations over large spatial scales. With Spatioformer, plant species richness maps over Australia are compiled from Landsat archive for the years from 2015 to 2023. The richness maps produced in this study reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant species richness in Australia, providing supporting evidence to inform effective planning and policy development for plant diversity conservation. Regions of high richness prediction uncertainties are identified, highlighting the need for future in-situ surveys to be conducted in these areas to enhance the prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.

Airborne hyperspectral imaging has shown promise for measuring plant diversity remotely, but to operationalise these efforts over large regions we need to advance satellite-based alternatives. The advanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique opportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground estimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to assess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for species richness prediction. The best prediction results were $r=0.76$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.89$ for the Southern Tablelands region, and $r=0.68$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.95$ for the Snowy Mountains region. Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral bands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more important for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the near-infrared bands beyond red-edge. We also found that the DESIS hyperspectral data performed better than Sentinel-2 multispectral data in the prediction of plant species richness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

In response, some maize plants naturally reorient their canopies to optimize light capture, a process known as canopy reorientation. Understanding this adaptive response and its impact on light capture is crucial for maximizing agricultural yield potential. This study introduces an end-to-end framework that integrates realistic 3D reconstructions of field-grown maize with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) modeling to assess the effects of phyllotaxy and planting density on light interception. In particular, using 3D point clouds derived from field data, virtual fields for a diverse set of maize genotypes were constructed and validated against field PAR measurements. Using this framework, we present detailed analyses of the impact of canopy orientations, plant and row spacings, and planting row directions on PAR interception throughout a typical growing season. Our findings highlight significant variations in light interception efficiency across different planting densities and canopy orientations. By elucidating the relationship between canopy architecture and light capture, this study offers valuable guidance for optimizing maize breeding and cultivation strategies across diverse agricultural settings.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

We present the Growth Modelling (GroMo) challenge, which is designed for two primary tasks: (1) plant age prediction and (2) leaf count estimation, both essential for crop monitoring and precision agriculture. For this challenge, we introduce GroMo25, a dataset with images of four crops: radish, okra, wheat, and mustard. Each crop consists of multiple plants (p1, p2, ..., pn) captured over different days (d1, d2, ..., dm) and categorized into five levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5). Each plant is captured from 24 different angles with a 15-degree gap between images. Participants are required to perform both tasks for all four crops with these multiview images. We proposed a Multiview Vision Transformer (MVVT) model for the GroMo challenge and evaluated the crop-wise performance on GroMo25. MVVT reports an average MAE of 7.74 for age prediction and an MAE of 5.52 for leaf count. The GroMo Challenge aims to advance plant phenotyping research by encouraging innovative solutions for tracking and predicting plant growth.

By incorporating Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) within the bi-level optimization framework, the proposed strategy enables VPPs to mitigate financial risks associated with uncertain market conditions. The upper-level problem seeks to maximize revenue through optimal bidding, while the lower-level problem ensures market-clearing compliance. The integration of the P2H system allows surplus renewable energy to be stored as hydrogen, which is utilized as an energy carrier, thereby increasing market profitability and enhancing resilience against financial risks. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through a modified IEEE 14 bus system, demonstrating that the inclusion of the P2H system and CVaR-based risk aversion enhances both revenue and financial hedging capability under volatile market conditions.This paper underscores the strategic role of hydrogen storage in VPP operations, contributing to supporting improved profitability and the efficacy of a risk-aware bidding strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2025 PES General Meeting</p></details> |

However, the increasing complexity of robots has led to a growing demand for advanced simulation and control methods to predict robot behavior and optimize plant performance, motivating the use of digital twins for robotic applications. Most existing digital twins only address parts of systems and do not offer a total design of a nuclear power plant. Furthermore, they are often designed for specific algorithms or tasks, making them unsuitable for broader research applications or projects. In response, this work proposes a comprehensive nuclear power plant digital twin designed to improve real-time monitoring, operational efficiency, and predictive maintenance. The full nuclear power plant is modeled in Unreal Engine 5 to incorporate the complexities and various phenomena. The high-resolution simulation environment is integrated with a Generic Pressurized Water Reactor Simulator, a high-fidelity physics-driven software, to create a realistic model of a nuclear power plant and a real-time updated virtual environment. The virtual environment provides various features for researchers to easily test custom robot algorithms and frameworks, applicable to research in the nuclear industry as well as industrial systems in general. The digital twin's performance is presented, and critical research problems are addressed, including multi-robot task scheduling and robot navigation in radiation-affected areas, by leveraging implemented features.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures; submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Domain Consistent Industrial Decarbonisation of Global Coal Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03571v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and optimisation techniques (MLOPT) hold significant potential to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial systems by enabling data-driven operational improvements. However, the practical application of MLOPT in industrial settings is often hindered by a lack of domain compliance and system-specific consistency, resulting in suboptimal solutions with limited real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop (HITL) constraint-based optimisation framework that integrates domain expertise with data-driven methods, ensuring solutions are both technically sound and operationally feasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through a case study focused on enhancing the thermal efficiency and reducing the turbine heat rate of a 660 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant. By embedding domain knowledge as constraints within the optimisation process, our approach yields solutions that align with the plant's operational patterns and are seamlessly integrated into its control systems. Empirical validation confirms a mean improvement in thermal efficiency of 0.64\% and a mean reduction in turbine heat rate of 93 kJ/kWh. Scaling our analysis to 59 global coal power plants with comparable capacity and fuel type, we estimate a cumulative lifetime reduction of 156.4 million tons of carbon emissions. These results underscore the transformative potential of our HITL-MLOPT framework in delivering domain-compliant, implementable solutions for industrial decarbonisation, offering a scalable pathway to mitigate the environmental impact of coal-based power generation worldwide.</p></details> | 6 figures. 17 pages |

However, the large number of devices and the need for privacy preservation in coal mines pose challenges to accurately aggregating these resources into a cohesive coal mine VPP. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable data-driven approach for FRA in the coal mine VPP that can manage incomplete information. Our data-driven FRA algorithm approximates equipment and FRA parameters based on historical energy dispatch data, effectively addressing the challenges of imperfect information. Simulation results illustrate that our method approximates the accurate feasible operational boundaries under dynamic and imperfect information conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for 2025 IEEE PES General Meeting</p></details> |
| **[Scheduling Power-Intensive Operations of Battery Energy Storage Systems and Application to Hybrid Hydropower Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16821v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel set of power constraints for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), referred to as Dynamic Power Constraints (DPCs), that account for the voltage and current limits of the BESS as a function of its State of Charge (SOC). These constraints are formulated for integration into optimization-based BESS scheduling problems, providing a significant improvement over traditional static constraints. It is shown that, under mild assumptions typically verified during practical operations, DPCs can be expressed as a linear function of the BESS power, thus making it possible to retrofit existing scheduling problems without altering their tractability property (i.e., convexity). The DCPs unify voltage and current constraints into a single framework, filling a gap between simplified models used in BESS schedulers and more advanced models in real-time controllers and Battery Management Systems (BMSs). By improving the representation of the BESS's power capability, the proposed constraints enable schedulers to make more reliable and feasible decision, especially in power-intensive applications where the BESS operates near its rated power. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPCs, a simulation-based performance evaluation is conducted using a hybrid system comprising a 230 MW Hydropower Plant (HPP) and a 750 kVA/500 kWh BESS. Compared to state-of-the-art formulations such as static power constraints and DPC formulations without voltage constraints the proposed method reduces BESS constraint violations by 93% during real-time operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel approach to navigate the taxonomic hierarchy to address the Open-World Scenarios in Medicinal Plant Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17289v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostic Method for Hydropower Plant Condition-based Maintenance combining Autoencoder with Clustering Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03649v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The French company EDF uses supervisory control and data acquisition systems in conjunction with a data management platform to monitor hydropower plant, allowing engineers and technicians to analyse the time-series collected. Depending on the strategic importance of the monitored hydropower plant, the number of time-series collected can vary greatly making it difficult to generate valuable information from the extracted data. In an attempt to provide an answer to this particular problem, a condition detection and diagnosis method combining clustering algorithms and autoencoder neural networks for pattern recognition has been developed and is presented in this paper. First, a dimension reduction algorithm is used to create a 2-or 3-dimensional projection that allows the users to identify unsuspected relationships between datapoints. Then, a collection of clustering algorithms regroups the datapoints into clusters. For each identified cluster, an autoencoder neural network is trained on the corresponding dataset. The aim is to measure the reconstruction error between each autoencoder model and the measured values, thus creating a proximity index for each state discovered during the clustering stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15957v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity? In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold. Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</p></details> | 80 pages |

Different from conventional Ising models, the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase transition of this binary-spin two-body interaction system is discontinuous, as the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ferromagnetic phase by an extensive free energy barrier. The free energy landscape can be distinguished into three different types depending on the two degree parameters of the planted graph. The critical inverse temperatures at which the paramagnetic phase becomes locally unstable towards the ferromagnetic phase ($\beta_{\textrm{pf}}$) and towards spin glass phases ($\beta_{\textrm{pg}}$) satisfy $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} > \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} < \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$ and $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} = \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, respectively, in these three landscapes. A locally stable anti-ferromagnetic phase emerges in the free energy landscape if $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} < \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$. When exploring the free energy landscape by stochastic local search dynamics, we find that in agreement with our theoretical prediction, the first-passage time from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase is nonmonotonic with the inverse temperature. The potential relevance of the planted vertex cover model to supercooled glass-forming liquids is briefly discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extensively revised and expanded.

For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, each edge $e$ has a non-negative weight drawn independently from $P_n$ if $e \in M_n^*$ and from $Q_n$ otherwise, where $P_n \equiv P$ is fixed and $Q_n$ scales with $n$ such that its density at the origin satisfies $\lim_{n\to\infty} n Q'_n(0)=1.$ We consider two representative cases: when $M_n^*$ is either a uniform spanning tree or a uniform Hamiltonian path. We analyze the recovery performance of the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm and derive a fixed-point equation that characterizes the asymptotic fraction of edges in $M_n^*$ successfully recovered by the MST as $n \to \infty.$ Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic mean weight of the MST, extending Frieze's $\zeta(3)$ result to the planted model. Leveraging this result, we design an efficient test based on the MST weight and show that it can distinguish the planted model from the unplanted model with vanishing testing error as $n \to \infty.$ Our analysis relies on an asymptotic characterization of the local structure of the planted model, employing the framework of local weak convergence.</p></details> |  |

Accurate quantification of these emissions is crucial for effective climate mitigation strategies. While satellite-based plume inversion offers a promising approach, challenges arise from data limitations and the complexity of atmospheric conditions. This study addresses these challenges by (a) expanding the available dataset through the integration of NO2 data from Sentinel-5P, generating continuous XCO2 maps, and incorporating real satellite observations from OCO-2/3 for over 71 power plants in data-scarce regions; and (b) employing a customized U-Net model capable of handling diverse spatio-temporal resolutions for emission rate estimation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods. By leveraging this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of major CO2 emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and informing regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Visual Localization via Semantic Structures in Autonomous Photovoltaic Power Plant Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14587v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspection systems utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with thermal cameras are increasingly popular for the maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles. This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. Detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image and associate these with the power plant model. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. We present three distinct methods for visual segmentation of PV modules based on traditional computer vision, deep learning, and their fusion, and we evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline. The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model's precision on the localization methods.</p></details> | 47 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Procedural Generation of 3D Maize Plant Architecture from LIDAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13963v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a robust framework for generating procedural 3D models of maize (Zea mays) plants from LiDAR point cloud data, offering a scalable alternative to traditional field-based phenotyping. Our framework leverages Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces to model the leaves of maize plants, combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for an initial approximation of the surface and a differentiable programming framework for precise refinement of the surface to fit the point cloud data. In the first optimization phase, PSO generates an approximate NURBS surface by optimizing its control points, aligning the surface with the LiDAR data, and providing a reliable starting point for refinement. The second phase uses NURBS-Diff, a differentiable programming framework, to enhance the accuracy of the initial fit by refining the surface geometry and capturing intricate leaf details. Our results demonstrate that, while PSO establishes a robust initial fit, the integration of differentiable NURBS significantly improves the overall quality and fidelity of the reconstructed surface. This hierarchical optimization strategy enables accurate 3D reconstruction of maize leaves across diverse genotypes, facilitating the subsequent extraction of complex traits like phyllotaxy. We demonstrate our approach on diverse genotypes of field-grown maize plants. All our codes are open-source to democratize these phenotyping approaches.</p></details> |  |

We combine theoretical foundations with practical applications, focusing on both combined cycle and nuclear power plant contexts. The study demonstrates the advantages of the IG distribution in modeling right-skewed industrial data, particularly in power generation. Using the UCI Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset, we establishthe superiority of IG-based models over traditional approaches through rigorous statistical testing and model validation. The methodology developed here extends naturally to nuclear power plant applications, where similar statistical patterns emerge in operational data.

| **[Automatic Fused Multimodal Deep Learning for Plant Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01455v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plant classification is vital for ecological conservation and agricultural productivity, enhancing our understanding of plant growth dynamics and aiding species preservation. The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs -- flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems -- into a cohesive model. To address the lack of multimodal datasets, we contributed Multimodal-PlantCLEF, a restructured version of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset tailored for multimodal tasks. Our method achieves 82.61% accuracy on 979 classes of Multimodal-PlantCLEF, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and outperforming late fusion by 10.33%. Through the incorporation of multimodal dropout, our approach demonstrates strong robustness to missing modalities. We validate our model against established benchmarks using standard performance metrics and McNemar's test, further underscoring its superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Traditional Medicinal Plant Leaves Using an effective Deep Learning model and Self-Curated Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09363v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicinal plants have been a key component in producing traditional and modern medicines, especially in the field of Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system. Producing these medicines and collecting and extracting the right plant is a crucial step due to the visually similar nature of some plants. The extraction of these plants from nonmedicinal plants requires human expert intervention. To solve the issue of accurate plant identification and reduce the need for a human expert in the collection process; employing computer vision methods will be efficient and beneficial. In this paper, we have proposed a model that solves such issues. The proposed model is a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with 6 convolution layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The model was tested on three different datasets named Indian Medicinal Leaves Image Dataset,MED117 Medicinal Plant Leaf Dataset, and the self-curated dataset by the authors. The proposed model achieved respective accuracies of 99.5%, 98.4%, and 99.7% using various optimizers including Adam, RMSprop, and SGD with momentum.</p></details> |  |

This work focuses on generating synthetic forestry images that satisfy certain phenotypic attributes, viz. canopy greenness. We harness a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize biologically plausible and phenotypically stable forestry images conditioned on the greenness of vegetation (a continuous attribute) over a specific region of interest, describing a particular vegetation type in a mixed forest. The training data is based on the automated digital camera imagery provided by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and processed by the PhenoCam Network. Our method helps render the appearance of forest sites specific to a greenness value. The synthetic images are subsequently utilized to predict another phenotypic attribute, viz., redness of plants. The quality of the synthetic images is assessed using the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). Further, the greenness and redness indices of the synthetic images are compared against those of the original images using Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) to evaluate their accuracy and integrity. The generalizability and scalability of our proposed GAN model are established by effectively transforming it to generate synthetic images for other forest sites and vegetation types. From a broader perspective, this approach could be leveraged to visualize forestry based on different phenotypic attributes in the context of various environmental parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Pattern Recognition journal</p></details> |

The review addresses the critical need for advanced computational methods in microscale investigations. We systematically analyse experimental studies in PBFM drying, highlighting their contributions and limitations in capturing cellular-level phenomena, including challenges in data acquisition and measurement accuracy under varying drying conditions. The evolution of computational models for microstructural investigations is thoroughly examined, from traditional numerical methods to contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, with specific focus on their ability to handle the complex, nonlinear properties of plant cellular materials. Special attention is given to the emergence of data-driven models and their limitations in predicting microscale cellular behaviour during PBFM drying, particularly addressing challenges in dataset acquisition and model generalization. The review provides an in-depth analysis of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) frameworks, examining their theoretical foundations, current applications in related fields, and unique advantages in combining physical principles with neural network architectures. Through this comprehensive assessment, we identify critical gaps in existing methodologies, evaluate the trade-offs between different modelling approaches, and provide insights into future research directions for improving our understanding of cellular-level transformations during PBFM drying processes.

| **[Local Foreground Selection aware Attentive Feature Reconstruction for few-shot fine-grained plant species classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06909v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plant species exhibit significant intra-class variation and minimal inter-class variation. To enhance classification accuracy, it is essential to reduce intra-class variation while maximizing inter-class variation. This paper addresses plant species classification using a limited number of labelled samples and introduces a novel Local Foreground Selection(LFS) attention mechanism. LFS is a straightforward module designed to generate discriminative support and query feature maps. It operates by integrating two types of attention: local attention, which captures local spatial details to enhance feature discrimination and increase inter-class differentiation, and foreground selection attention, which emphasizes the foreground plant object while mitigating background interference. By focusing on the foreground, the query and support features selectively highlight relevant feature sequences and disregard less significant background sequences, thereby reducing intra-class differences. Experimental results from three plant species datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LFS attention mechanism and its complementary advantages over previous feature reconstruction methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning: A Review and A Proposed System on Bangladesh's Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03305v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A very crucial part of Bangladeshi people's employment, GDP contribution, and mainly livelihood is agriculture. It plays a vital role in decreasing poverty and ensuring food security. Plant diseases are a serious stumbling block in agricultural production in Bangladesh. At times, humans can't detect the disease from an infected leaf with the naked eye. Using inorganic chemicals or pesticides in plants when it's too late leads in vain most of the time, deposing all the previous labor. The deep-learning technique of leaf-based image classification, which has shown impressive results, can make the work of recognizing and classifying all diseases trouble-less and more precise. In this paper, we've mainly proposed a better model for the detection of leaf diseases. Our proposed paper includes the collection of data on three different kinds of crops: bell peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes. For training and testing the proposed CNN model, the plant leaf disease dataset collected from Kaggle is used, which has 17,430 images. The images are labeled with 14 separate classes of damage. The developed CNN model performs efficiently and could successfully detect and classify the tested diseases. The proposed CNN model may have great potency in crop disease management.</p></details> |  |

Our work utilizes 88,987 plant survey records conducted in specific spatiotemporal contexts across Europe. We also use the corresponding satellite images, time series data, climate time series, and other rasterized environmental data such as land cover, human footprint, bioclimatic, and soil variables as training data to train the model to predict the outcomes of 4,716 plant surveys. We propose a feature construction and result correction method based on the graph structure. Through comparative experiments, we select the best-performing backbone networks for feature extraction in both temporal and image modalities. In this process, we built a backbone network based on the Swin-Transformer Block for extracting temporal Cubes features. We then design a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism capable of robustly fusing features from multiple modalities. During training, we adopt a 10-fold cross-fusion method based on fine-tuning and use a Threshold Top-K method for post-processing. Ablation experiments demonstrate the improvements in model performance brought by our proposed solution pipeline.</p></details> | CVPR GeolifeCLEF |

| **[DDD: Discriminative Difficulty Distance for plant disease diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00734v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on plant disease diagnosis using machine learning (ML) have highlighted concerns about the overestimated diagnostic performance due to inappropriate data partitioning, where training and test datasets are derived from the same source (domain). Plant disease diagnosis presents a challenging classification task, characterized by its fine-grained nature, vague symptoms, and the extensive variability of image features within each domain. In this study, we propose the concept of Discriminative Difficulty Distance (DDD), a novel metric designed to quantify the domain gap between training and test datasets while assessing the classification difficulty of test data. DDD provides a valuable tool for identifying insufficient diversity in training data, thus supporting the development of more diverse and robust datasets. We investigated multiple image encoders trained on different datasets and examined whether the distances between datasets, measured using low-dimensional representations generated by the encoders, are suitable as a DDD metric. The study utilized 244,063 plant disease images spanning four crops and 34 disease classes collected from 27 domains. As a result, we demonstrated that even if the test images are from different crops or diseases than those used to train the encoder, incorporating them allows the construction of a distance measure for a dataset that strongly correlates with the difficulty of diagnosis indicated by the disease classifier developed independently. Compared to the base encoder, pre-trained only on ImageNet21K, the correlation higher by 0.106 to 0.485, reaching a maximum of 0.909.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables.

This enables the precision application of herbicide only to weeds, or the precision application of fertilizer only to undernourished crops, rather than to the entire field. The approach promises to maximize yields while minimizing resource use and harm to the surrounding environment. To this end, we propose a hierarchical panoptic segmentation method that simultaneously determines leaf count (as an identifier of plant growth)and locates weeds within an image. In particular, our approach aims to improve the segmentation of smaller instances like the leaves and weeds by incorporating focal loss and boundary loss. Not only does this result in competitive performance, achieving a PQ+ of 81.89 on the standard training set, but we also demonstrate we can improve leaf-counting accuracy with our method.

| **[A Hybrid Technique for Plant Disease Identification and Localisation in Real-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19682v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, several image-processing methods and algorithms have been proposed for identifying plant diseases based on visual data. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) have recently become popular for this task. Both traditional image processing and DNN-based methods encounter significant performance issues in real-time detection owing to computational limitations and a broad spectrum of plant disease features. This article proposes a novel technique for identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is hybrid as it exploits the advantages of traditional image processing methods and DNN-based models at different scales, resulting in faster inference. The F1 score is approximately 0.80 for four disease classes corresponding to potato and tomato crops.</p></details> |  |

This review explores various works on state-of-the-art predictive pattern recognition techniques, focusing on the spatiotemporal modeling of plant traits and the integration of dynamic environmental interactions. We provide a comprehensive examination of deterministic, probabilistic, and generative modeling approaches, emphasizing their applications in high-throughput phenotyping and simulation-based plant growth forecasting. Key topics include regressions and neural network-based representation models for the task of forecasting, limitations of existing experiment-based deterministic approaches, and the need for dynamic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty and evolving environmental feedback. This review surveys advances in 2D and 3D structured data representations through functional-structural plant models and conditional generative models. We offer a perspective on opportunities for future works, emphasizing the integration of domain-specific knowledge to data-driven methods, improvements to available datasets, and the implementation of these techniques toward real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation: Practical Learning Strategies for an Automated Plant Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18859v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous studies have explored image-based automated systems for plant disease diagnosis, demonstrating impressive diagnostic capabilities. However, recent large-scale analyses have revealed a critical limitation: that the diagnostic capability suffers significantly when validated on images captured in environments (domains) differing from those used during training. This shortfall stems from the inherently limited dataset size and the diverse manifestation of disease symptoms, combined with substantial variations in cultivation environments and imaging conditions, such as equipment and composition. These factors lead to insufficient variety in training data, ultimately constraining the system's robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation (FMDA), a flexible and effective approach for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in practical systems, even when only limited target data is available. FMDA reduces domain discrepancies by introducing a constraint to the diagnostic model that minimizes the "distance" between feature spaces of source (training) data and target data with limited samples. FMDA is computationally efficient, requiring only basic feature distance calculations and backpropagation, and can be seamlessly integrated into any machine learning (ML) pipeline. In large-scale experiments, involving 223,015 leaf images across 20 fields and 3 crop species, FMDA achieved F1 score improvements of 11.1 to 29.3 points compared to cases without target data, using only 10 images per disease from the target domain. Moreover, FMDA consistently outperformed fine-tuning methods utilizing the same data, with an average improvement of 8.5 points.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Leveraging Neural Networks to Optimize Heliostat Field Aiming Strategies in Concentrating Solar Power Tower Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16995v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concentrating Solar Power Tower (CSPT) plants rely on heliostat fields to focus sunlight onto a central receiver. Although simple aiming strategies, such as directing all heliostats to the receivers equator, can maximize energy collection, they often result in uneven flux distributions that lead to hotspots, thermal stresses, and reduced receiver lifetimes. This paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that integrates constraint learning, neural network-based surrogates, and mathematical optimization to overcome these challenges. The methodology learns complex heliostat-to-receiver flux interactions from simulation data, constructing a surrogate model that is embedded into a tractable optimization framework. By maximizing a tailored quality score that balances energy collection and flux uniformity, the approach yields smoothly distributed flux profiles and mitigates excessive thermal peaks. An iterative refinement process, guided by the trust region and progressive data sampling, ensures the surrogate model improves the obtained solution by exploring new spaces during the iterations. Results from a real CSPT case study demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses conventional heuristic methods, offering flatter flux distributions and safer thermal conditions without a substantial loss in overall energy capture.</p></details> |  |

However, agro-food environments pose difficulties for robots due to high variation and occlusions. In the presence of these challenges, accurate world models, with information about object location, shape, and properties, are crucial for robots to perform tasks accurately. Building such models is challenging due to the complex and unique nature of agro-food environments, and errors in the model can lead to task execution issues. In this paper, MinkSORT, a novel method for generating tracking features using a 3D sparse convolutional network in a deepSORT-like approach, is proposed to improve the accuracy of world models in agro-food environments. MinkSORT was evaluated using real-world data collected in a tomato greenhouse, where it significantly improved the performance of a baseline model that tracks tomato positions in 3D using a Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance. MinkSORT improved the HOTA from 42.8% to 44.77%, the association accuracy from 32.55% to 35.55%, and the MOTA from 57.63% to 58.81%. Different contrastive loss functions for training MinkSORT were also evaluated, and it was demonstrated that it leads to improved performance in terms of three separate precision and recall detection outcomes. The proposed method improves world model accuracy, enabling robots to perform tasks such as harvesting and plant maintenance with greater efficiency and accuracy, which is essential for meeting the growing demand for food in a sustainable manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-Aware Next-best-view Planning for Efficient Search and Detection of Task-relevant Plant Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09801v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching and detecting the task-relevant parts of plants is important to automate harvesting and de-leafing of tomato plants using robots. This is challenging due to high levels of occlusion in tomato plants. Active vision is a promising approach in which the robot strategically plans its camera viewpoints to overcome occlusion and improve perception accuracy. However, current active-vision algorithms cannot differentiate between relevant and irrelevant plant parts and spend time on perceiving irrelevant plant parts. This work proposed a semantics-aware active-vision strategy that uses semantic information to identify the relevant plant parts and prioritise them during view planning. The proposed strategy was evaluated on the task of searching and detecting the relevant plant parts using simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation experiments, the semantics-aware strategy proposed could search and detect 81.8% of the relevant plant parts using nine viewpoints. It was significantly faster and detected more plant parts than predefined, random, and volumetric active-vision strategies that do not use semantic information. The strategy proposed was also robust to uncertainty in plant and plant-part positions, plant complexity, and different viewpoint-sampling strategies. In real-world experiments, the semantics-aware strategy could search and detect 82.7% of the relevant plant parts using seven viewpoints, under complex greenhouse conditions with natural variation and occlusion, natural illumination, sensor noise, and uncertainty in camera poses. The results of this work clearly indicate the advantage of using semantics-aware active vision for targeted perception of plant parts and its applicability in the real world. It can significantly improve the efficiency of automated harvesting and de-leafing in tomato crop production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-driven Next-best-view Planning for Efficient Reconstruction of Plants and Targeted Plant Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10274v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in tomato greenhouses need to perceive the plant and plant parts accurately to automate monitoring, harvesting, and de-leafing tasks. Existing perception systems struggle with the high levels of occlusion in plants and often result in poor perception accuracy. One reason for this is because they use fixed cameras or predefined camera movements. Next-best-view (NBV) planning presents an alternate approach, in which the camera viewpoints are reasoned and strategically planned such that the perception accuracy is improved. However, existing NBV-planning algorithms are agnostic to the task-at-hand and give equal importance to all the plant parts. This strategy is inefficient for greenhouse tasks that require targeted perception of specific plant parts, such as the perception of leaf nodes for de-leafing. To improve targeted perception in complex greenhouse environments, NBV planning algorithms need an attention mechanism to focus on the task-relevant plant parts. In this paper, the role of attention in improving targeted perception using an attention-driven NBV planning strategy was investigated. Through simulation experiments using plants with high levels of occlusion and structural complexity, it was shown that focusing attention on task-relevant plant parts can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of 3D reconstruction. Further, with real-world experiments, it was shown that these benefits extend to complex greenhouse conditions with natural variation and occlusion, natural illumination, sensor noise, and uncertainty in camera poses. The results clearly indicate that using attention-driven NBV planning in greenhouses can significantly improve the efficiency of perception and enhance the performance of robotic systems in greenhouse crop production.</p></details> |  |

We conducted in-lab experiments exposing ivy (Hedera helix) plants to ozone, an important pollutant to monitor, and measured their electrophysiological response. However, there is no well established automated way of detecting ozone exposure in plants. We propose a generic automatic toolchain to select a high-performance subset of features and highly accurate models for plant electrophysiology. Our approach derives plant- and stimulus-generic features from the electrophysiological signal using the tsfresh library. Based on these features, we automatically select and optimize machine learning models using AutoML. We use forward feature selection to increase model performance. We show that our approach successfully classifies plant ozone exposure with accuracies of up to 94.6% on unseen data. We also show that our approach can be used for other plant species and stimuli. Our toolchain automates the development of monitoring algorithms for plants as pollutant monitors. Our results help implement significant advancements for phytosensing devices contributing to the development of cost-effective, high-density urban air monitoring systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and Accepted at 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Energy, Transport and Environmental Sustainability (IEEE CIETES)</p></details> |

Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</p></details> | 55 pages, 4 figures |

With the pressing climate goals set and the potential of Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a climate-relevant technology, scaling up the number of new plants to over 1000 facilities per year by 2030 becomes imperative. However, such a massive scale-up presents not only technical challenges but also control and regulation issues, ensuring maximal output of plants while conforming to regulatory requirements. In this paper, we present a novel method of optimizing the process of a biochar plant based on machine learning methods. We show how a standard Random Forest Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, the physics of which remains highly complex. This model then serves as a surrogate of the machine -- reproducing several key outcomes of the machine -- in a numerical optimization. This, in turn, could enable us to reduce NOx emissions -- a key regulatory goal in that industry -- while achieving maximal output still. In a preliminary test our approach shows remarkable results, proves to be applicable on two different machines from different manufacturers, and can be implemented on standard Internet of Things (IoT) devices more generally.</p></details> |  |

ACE automatically identifies the visual concepts found in the image data and provides insights about the critical features influencing the model predictions. This approach reveals both effective disease-related patterns and incidental biases, such as those from background or lighting that can compromise model robustness. Through systematic experiments, ACE helped us to identify relevant features and pinpoint areas for targeted model improvement. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ACE to improve the explainability of plant disease classification based on deep learning, which is essential for producing transparent tools for plant disease management in agriculture.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Silico Pharmacokinetic and Molecular Docking Studies of Natural Plants against Essential Protein KRAS for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06237v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A kind of pancreatic cancer called Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is anticipated to be one of the main causes of mortality during past years. Evidence from several researches supported the concept that the oncogenic KRAS (Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene) mutation is the major cause of pancreatic cancer. KRAS acts as an on-off switch that promotes cell growth. But when the KRAS gene is mutated, it will be in one position, allowing the cell growth uncontrollably. This uncontrollable multiplication of cells causes cancer growth. Therefore, KRAS was selected as the target protein in the study. Fifty plant-derived compounds are selected for the study. To determine whether the examined drugs could bind to the KRAS complex's binding pocket, molecular docking was performed. Computational analyses were used to assess the possible ability of tested substances to pass the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). To predict the bioactivity of ligands a machine learning model was created. Five machine learning models were created and have chosen the best one among them for analyzing the bioactivity of each ligand. From the fifty plant-derived compounds the compounds with the least binding energies are selected. Then bioactivity of these six compounds is analyzed using Random Forest Regression model. Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) properties of compounds are analyzed. The results showed that borneol has powerful effects and acts as a promising agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This suggests that borneol found in plants like mint, ginger, rosemary, etc., is a successful compound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed approach enables real-time analysis with multiple data types on a common map via the GIS, entails feature-extraction abilities due to the CNN, and captures long-range dependencies through the ViT. This hybrid approach is found to enhance classification, thus helping in the monitoring and operational management of power plants; hence assisting energy estimation and sustainable energy planning in the future. It exemplifies adequate deployment of machine learning methods in conjunction with domain-specific approaches to enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation of the Plant Controller Communication Time-Delay Considering PMSG-Based Wind Turbines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01751v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The communication control delay between the inverters and the power plant controller can be caused by several factors related to the communication link between them. Under undesirable conditions, high delay values can produce oscillations in the wind power plant that can affect the rest of the power system. In this work, we present a new robust methodology for wind turbines to estimate the value of the communication control delay using PMU data. Several scenarios are considered where external faults are simulated and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on dynamic state estimation of the mathematical model of the wind turbine. In this paper, we have shown that the characterization of the delay can be performed offering the transmission system operator an online tool to identify the most suited communication delay for the plant controller models used in dynamic studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal energy collection with rotational movements constraints in concentrated solar power plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19198v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants based on Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTC), the Sun is tracked at discrete time intervals, with each interval representing a movement of the collector system. The act of moving heavy mechanical structures can lead to the development of cracks, bending, and/or displacements of components from their optimal optical positions. This, in turn, diminishes the overall performance of the entire system for energy capture. In this context, we introduce two combinatorial optimization problems to limit the number of tracking steps of the collector and hence the risk of failure incidents and contaminant leaks. On the one hand, the Minimum Tracking Motion (MTM)-Problem aims at detecting the minimum number of movements while maintaining the production within a given range. On the other hand, the Maximal Energy Collection (MEC)-Problem aims to achieve optimal energy production within a predetermined number of movements. Both problems are solved assuming scenarios where the energy collection function contains any number of local maximum/minimum due to optical errors of the elements in the PTCsystem. The MTM- and MEC-Problems are solved in O(n) time and O(n2mw*) time, respectively, being n the number of steps in the energy collection function, m the maximum number of movements of the solar structure, and w* the maximal amplitude angle that the structure can cover. The advantages of the solutions are shown in realistic experiments. While these problems can be solved in polynomial time, we establish the NP-hardness of a slightly modified version of the MEC-Problem. The proposed algorithms are generic and can be adapted to schedule solar tracking in other CSP systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TreeFormer: Single-view Plant Skeleton Estimation via Tree-constrained Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16132v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of plant skeletal structure (e.g., branching structure) from images is essential for smart agriculture and plant science. Unlike human skeletons with fixed topology, plant skeleton estimation presents a unique challenge, i.e., estimating arbitrary tree graphs from images. While recent graph generation methods successfully infer thin structures from images, it is challenging to constrain the output graph strictly to a tree structure. To this problem, we present TreeFormer, a plant skeleton estimator via tree-constrained graph generation. Our approach combines learning-based graph generation with traditional graph algorithms to impose the constraints during the training loop. Specifically, our method projects an unconstrained graph onto a minimum spanning tree (MST) during the training loop and incorporates this prior knowledge into the gradient descent optimization by suppressing unwanted feature values. Experiments show that our method accurately estimates target plant skeletal structures for multiple domains: Synthetic tree patterns, real botanical roots, and grapevine branches. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/huntorochi/TreeFormer/.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond inherent robustness: strong stability of MPC despite plant-model mismatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15452v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the asymptotic stability of MPC under plant-model mismatch, considering primarily models where the origin remains a steady state despite mismatch. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in both algebraic and engineering examples. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 figures |

However, current 3D reconstruction methods fail to recover complete shapes of plants due to heavy occlusion and complex geometries. In this work, we present a novel method for 3D reconstruction of agricultural crops based on optimizing a parametric model of plant morphology via inverse procedural modeling. Our method first estimates depth maps by fitting a neural radiance field and then employs Bayesian optimization to estimate plant morphological parameters that result in consistent depth renderings. The resulting 3D model is complete and biologically plausible. We validate our method on a dataset of real images of agricultural fields, and demonstrate that the reconstructions can be used for a variety of monitoring and simulation applications.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Comparative Analysis of Electricity Consumption Flexibility in Different Industrial Plant Configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09279v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The flexibility of industrial power consumption plays a key role in the transition to renewable energy systems, contributing to grid stability, cost reduction and decarbonization efforts. This paper presents a novel methodology to quantify and optimize the flexibility of electricity consumption in manufacturing plants. The proposed model is applied to actual cement and steel plant configurations. Comparative simulations performed with the model reveal significant differences in flexibility and cost-effectiveness, driven by factors such as production capacity, downstream process demand, storage capacity, and operational constraints. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further clarifies the impact of various parameters on production optimization and flexibility savings. Specifically, as demand approaches production levels, flexibility decreases. Although increasing storage capacity typically reduces production costs, the benefits diminish above a certain threshold. The results provide valuable information for industrial operators wishing to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs and increase the flexibility of their operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Research on an intelligent fault diagnosis method for nuclear power plants based on ETCN-SSA combined algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06765v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing fault diagnosis methods is crucial for nuclear power professionals to achieve efficient and accurate fault diagnosis for nuclear power plants (NPPs). The performance of traditional methods is limited by their dependence on complex feature extraction and skilled expert knowledge, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This paper proposes a novel intelligent fault diagnosis method for NPPs that combines enhanced temporal convolutional network (ETCN) with sparrow search algorithm (SSA). ETCN utilizes temporal convolutional network (TCN), self-attention (SA) mechanism and residual block for enhancing performance. ETCN excels at extracting local features and capturing time series information, while SSA adaptively optimizes its hyperparameters for superior performance. The proposed method's performance is experimentally verified on a CPR1000 simulation dataset. Compared to other advanced intelligent fault diagnosis methods, the proposed one demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics. This makes it a promising tool for NPP intelligent fault diagnosis, ultimately enhancing operational reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974v2)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate "backdoor key", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model. Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is "clean" or contains a backdoor. Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an "adversarially robust" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, studies evidence difficulties of this test in detecting change points, especially in small samples. This study presents a bootstrap application of the Pettitt test, which is numerically compared with the classical Pettitt test by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. The proposed test outperforms the classical test in all simulated scenarios. An application of the tests is conducted in the historical series of naturalized flows of the Itaipu Hydroelectric plant in Brazil, where several studies have shown a change point in the 70s. When the series is split into shorter series, to simulate small sample actual situations, the proposed test is more powerful than the classical Pettitt test to detect the change point. The proposed test can be an important tool to detect abrupt changes in water availability, supporting hydroclimatological resources decision making.</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |

Next-Best-View (NBV) methods address this by iteratively selecting new viewpoints to maximize information gain (IG). Deep-learning-based NBV (DL-NBV) methods demonstrate higher computational efficiency over classic voxel-based NBV approaches but current methods require extensive training using ground-truth plant models, making them impractical for real-world plants. These methods, moreover, rely on offline training with pre-collected data, limiting adaptability in changing agricultural environments. This paper proposes a self-supervised learning-based NBV method (SSL-NBV) that uses a deep neural network to predict the IG for candidate viewpoints. The method allows the robot to gather its own training data during task execution by comparing new 3D sensor data to the earlier gathered data and by employing weakly-supervised learning and experience replay for efficient online learning. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted in simulation and real-world environments using cross-validation. The results showed that SSL-NBV required fewer views for plant reconstruction than non-NBV methods and was over 800 times faster than a voxel-based method. SSL-NBV reduced training annotations by over 90% compared to a baseline DL-NBV. Furthermore, SSL-NBV could adapt to novel scenarios through online fine-tuning. Also using real plants, the results showed that the proposed method can learn to effectively plan new viewpoints for 3D plant reconstruction. Most importantly, SSL-NBV automated the entire network training and uses continuous online learning, allowing it to operate in changing agricultural environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce PLANT -- Pretrained and Leveraged AtteNTion -- a novel transfer learning strategy for fine-tuning XMTC decoders. PLANT surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across all metrics on mimicfull, mimicfifty, mimicfour, eurlex, and wikiten datasets. It particularly excels in few-shot scenarios, outperforming previous models specifically designed for few-shot scenarios by over 50 percentage points in F1 scores on mimicrare and by over 36 percentage points on mimicfew, demonstrating its superior capability in handling rare codes. PLANT also shows remarkable data efficiency in few-shot scenarios, achieving precision comparable to traditional models with significantly less data. These results are achieved through key technical innovations: leveraging a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model as the planted attention layer, integrating mutual-information gain to enhance attention, introducing an inattention mechanism, and implementing a stateful-decoder to maintain context. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the importance of these contributions in realizing the performance gains.</p></details> |  |

A custom dataset was developed featuring both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12 leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection, proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes. Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10 epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in adapting to dynamic visual data. These findings validate RF-DETR's effectiveness for precision agricultural applications, with YOLOv12 suited for fast-response scenarios. >Index Terms: RF-DETR object detection, YOLOv12, YOLOv13, YOLOv14, YOLOv15, YOLOE, YOLO World, YOLO, You Only Look Once, Roboflow, Detection Transformers, CNNs</p></details> |  |

Changes in the operational environment have been known to negatively impact the stability of AI-enabled software systems by causing unintended changes in behavior. However, how an environment configuration impacts the behavior of such systems has yet to be explored. Understanding and quantifying the degree of instability caused by different environment settings can help practitioners decide the best environment configuration for the most stable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we performed experiments with eight different combinations of three key environment variables (operating system, Python version, and CPU architecture) on $30$ open-source AI-enabled systems using the Travis CI platform. We determine the existence and the degree of instability introduced by each configuration using three metrics: the output of an AI component of the system (model performance), the time required to build and run the system (processing time), and the cost associated with building and running the system (expense). Our results indicate that changes in environment configurations lead to instability across all three metrics; however, it is observed more frequently with respect to processing time and expense rather than model performance. For example, between Linux and MacOS, instability is observed in 23\%, 96.67\%, and 100\% of the studied projects in model performance, processing time, and expense, respectively. Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the optimal combination of configuration settings to mitigate drops in model performance and reduce the processing time and expense before deploying an AI-enabled system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

While physiological measures show promise for error detection in laboratory settings, their effectiveness in dynamic flight environments remains underexplored. Through live flight trials with nine commercial pilots, we investigated whether established error-detection approaches maintain accuracy during actual flight operations. Participants completed standardized multi-tasking scenarios across conditions ranging from laboratory settings to straight-and-level flight and 2G manoeuvres while we collected synchronized physiological data. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based classification maintains high accuracy (87.83%) during complex flight manoeuvres, comparable to laboratory performance (89.23%). Eye-tracking showed moderate performance (82.50\%), while ECG performed near chance level (51.50%). Classification accuracy remained stable across flight conditions, with minimal degradation during 2G manoeuvres. These results provide the first evidence that physiological error detection can translate effectively to operational aviation environments.</p></details> |  |

This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Causa...</summary><p>Causal Discovery and Inference - Robot Autonomy - Human-Robot Spatial Interaction - Decision-Making</p></details> |

While prior work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CogSci 2025, In-review for ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt engineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within controlled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that fail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we introduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search interactions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information exists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy, unstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized multi-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information from various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical challenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate that DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over prompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL agents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from end-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans, cross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to redirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers. Our results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments is not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for developing robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.

This paper presents a novel approach combining a graph neural network-based exploration greedy policy with a safety shield to ensure safe navigation goal selection. The network is trained using reinforcement learning and the proximal policy optimization algorithm to maximize exploration efficiency while reducing the safety shield interventions. However, if the policy selects an infeasible action, the safety shield intervenes to choose the best feasible alternative, ensuring system consistency. Moreover, this paper proposes a reward function that includes a potential field based on the agent's proximity to unexplored regions and the expected information gain from reaching them. Overall, the approach investigated in this paper merges the benefits of the adaptability of reinforcement learning-driven exploration policies and the guarantee ensured by explicit safety mechanisms. Extensive evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that the approach enables efficient and safe exploration in cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

With this shift, wireless systems cannot only take on vital services previously handled by wired infrastructures but also enable novel innovative applications that would not be possible with wired systems. As a result, there is a pressing demand for strategies that can adapt to dynamic channel conditions, interference, and unforeseen disruptions, ensuring seamless and reliable performance in an increasingly complex environment. Despite considerable research, existing resilience assessments lack comprehensive key performance indicators (KPIs), especially those quantifying its adaptability, which are vital for identifying a system's capacity to rapidly adapt and reallocate resources. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the adaption performance by augmenting the gradient of the system's rate function. To further enhance the network resilience, we integrate Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) into our framework due to their capability to dynamically reshape the propagation environment while providing alternative channel paths. Numerical results show that gradient augmentation enhances resilience by improving adaptability under adverse conditions while proactively preparing for future disruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Globecom 2025</p></details> |

Existing AI-based detection systems struggle to adapt to new attack strategies and lack real-time attack detection capabilities with high accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes an online, continuous learning methodology for DDoS detection in M-En networks, enabling continuous model updates and real-time adaptation to emerging threats, including zero-day attacks. First, we develop a unique M-En network dataset by setting up a realistic, real-time simulation using the NS-3 tool, incorporating both victim and bot devices. DDoS attacks with varying packet sizes are simulated using the DDoSim application across IoT and traditional IP-based environments under M-En network criteria. Our approach employs a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning models: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet dataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly accurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low confidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification and potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models demonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human intervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to enhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF through real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy of 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632 MB) and CPU utilization (10.05%) in real-time scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied World Models Emerge from Navigational Task in Open-Ended Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11419v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how artificial systems can develop spatial awareness and reasoning has long been a challenge in AI research. Traditional models often rely on passive observation, but embodied cognition theory suggests that deeper understanding emerges from active interaction with the environment. This study investigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial concepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we show that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction, distance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS) to model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system, revealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies. Ridge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional behavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations, suggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge. Intervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are causally linked to navigation performance. This work provides an approach to bridging the gap between action and perception in AI, offering new insights into building adaptive, interpretable models that can generalize across complex environments. The causal validation of neural representations also opens new avenues for understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms of AI systems, pushing the boundaries of how machines learn and reason in dynamic, real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research on explainable meta-reinforcement learning AI</p></details> |

While models such as Florence2, built on transformer architectures, have shown promise across general tasks, their performance in object detection within unstructured or cluttered environments remains underexplored. In this study, we fi-ne-tuned the Florence2 model for object detection tasks in non-constructed, complex environments. A comprehensive experimental framework was established involving multiple hardware configurations (NVIDIA T4, L4, and A100 GPUs), optimizers (AdamW, SGD), and varied hyperparameters including learning rates and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) setups. Model training and evaluation were conducted on challenging datasets representative of real-world, disordered settings. The optimized Florence2 models exhibited significant improvements in object detection accuracy, with Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics approaching or matching those of estab-lished models such as YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The integration of LoRA and careful fine-tuning of transformer layers contributed notably to these gains. Our find-ings highlight the adaptability of transformer-based VLMs like Florence2 for do-main-specific tasks, particularly in visually complex environments. The study under-scores the potential of fine-tuned VLMs to rival traditional convolution-based detec-tors, offering a flexible and scalable approach for advanced vision applications in re-al-world, unstructured settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Constraint-Aware Zero-Shot Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10137v4)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the task of Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) under the zero-shot setting. Zero-shot VLN-CE is particularly challenging due to the absence of expert demonstrations for training and minimal environment structural prior to guide navigation. To confront these challenges, we propose a Constraint-Aware Navigator (CA-Nav), which reframes zero-shot VLN-CE as a sequential, constraint-aware sub-instruction completion process. CA-Nav continuously translates sub-instructions into navigation plans using two core modules: the Constraint-Aware Sub-instruction Manager (CSM) and the Constraint-Aware Value Mapper (CVM). CSM defines the completion criteria for decomposed sub-instructions as constraints and tracks navigation progress by switching sub-instructions in a constraint-aware manner. CVM, guided by CSM's constraints, generates a value map on the fly and refines it using superpixel clustering to improve navigation stability. CA-Nav achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two VLN-CE benchmarks, surpassing the previous best method by 12 percent and 13 percent in Success Rate on the validation unseen splits of R2R-CE and RxR-CE, respectively. Moreover, CA-Nav demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world robot deployments across various indoor scenes and instructions.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback methods have shown promise in reducing feedback overhead, their generalization capability across varying propagation environments remains limited due to their data-driven nature. Existing solutions based on online training improve adaptability but impose significant overhead in terms of data collection and computational resources. In this work, we propose AdapCsiNet, an environment-adaptive DL-based CSI feedback framework that eliminates the need for online training. By integrating environmental information -- represented as a scene graph -- into a hypernetwork-guided CSI reconstruction process, AdapCsiNet dynamically adapts to diverse channel conditions. A two-step training strategy is introduced to ensure baseline reconstruction performance and effective environment-aware adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate that AdapCsiNet achieves up to 46.4% improvement in CSI reconstruction accuracy and matches the performance of online learning methods without incurring additional runtime overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7figures, submitted to IEEE conference for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite recent advances in neural approaches for Room Impulse Response (RIR) estimation, most existing methods are limited to the single environment on which they are trained, lacking the ability to generalize to new rooms with different geometries and surface materials. We aim to develop a unified model capable of reconstructing the spatial acoustic experience of any environment with minimum additional measurements. To this end, we present xRIR, a framework for cross-room RIR prediction. The core of our generalizable approach lies in combining a geometric feature extractor, which captures spatial context from panorama depth images, with a RIR encoder that extracts detailed acoustic features from only a few reference RIR samples. To evaluate our method, we introduce ACOUSTICROOMS, a new dataset featuring high-fidelity simulation of over 300,000 RIRs from 260 rooms. Experiments show that our method strongly outperforms a series of baselines. Furthermore, we successfully perform sim-to-real transfer by evaluating our model on four real-world environments, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach and the realism of our dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

| **[A Benchmarking Environment for Worker Flexibility in Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16159v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Production Scheduling, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) aims to optimize a sequence of operations and assign each to an eligible machine with varying processing times. For integration of the workforce, each machine also requires a worker to be present to process an operation which additionally affects the processing times. The resulting problem is called Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-W). The FJSSP has been approached with various problem representations, including Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Constrained Programming (CP), and Simulation-based Optimization (SBO). In the latter area in particular, there exists a large number of specialized Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Yet, the solvers are often developed for single use cases only, and validated on a few selected test instances, let alone compared with results from solvers using other problem representations. While suitable approaches do also exist, the design of the FJSSP-W instances is not standardized and the algorithms are hardly comparable. This calls for a systematic benchmarking environment that provides a comprehensive set of FJSSP(-W) instances and supports targeted algorithm development. It will facilitate the comparison of algorithmic performance in the face of different problem characteristics. The present paper presents a collection of 402 commonly accepted FJSSP instances and proposes an approach to extend these with worker flexibility. In addition, we present a detailed procedure for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms on these problem sets and provide suitable model representations for this purpose. We provide complexity characteristics for all presented instances as well as baseline results of common commercial solvers to facilitate the validation of new algorithmic developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages.

Previous work shows that an environment's color temperature affects the experienced temperature. As virtual reality (VR) enables visual immersion, recent work suggests that a VR scene's color temperature also affects experienced temperature. In addition, virtual avatars representing thermal cues influence users' thermal perception and even the body temperature. As immersive technology becomes increasingly prevalent in daily life, leveraging thermal cues to enhance thermal comfort - without relying on actual thermal energy - presents a promising opportunity. Understanding these effects is crucial for optimizing virtual experiences and promoting sustainable energy practices.

However, the large data centres where cloud computing services are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components. This issue is exacerbated by the increasing deployment of large artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often rely on distributed data centres, thereby significantly impacting the global environment. This study proposes the COUNTER model, designed for sustainable cloud resource management. COUNTER is integrated with cluster graph neural networks and evaluated in a simulated cloud environment, aiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining quality of service parameters. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in resource utilisation, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness compared to the baseline model, HUNTER, which employs a gated graph neural network aimed at achieving carbon neutrality in cloud computing for modern ICT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version accepted at IEEE ICDCS 2025</p></details> |

Compared to discrete settings, VLN-CE poses two core perception challenges. First, the absence of predefined observation points leads to heterogeneous visual memories and weakened global spatial correlations. Second, cumulative reconstruction errors in three-dimensional scenes introduce structural noise, impairing local feature perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ST-Booster, an iterative spatiotemporal booster that enhances navigation performance through multi-granularity perception and instruction-aware reasoning. ST-Booster consists of three key modules -- Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Encoding (HSTE), Multi-Granularity Aligned Fusion (MGAF), and ValueGuided Waypoint Generation (VGWG). HSTE encodes long-term global memory using topological graphs and captures shortterm local details via grid maps. MGAF aligns these dualmap representations with instructions through geometry-aware knowledge fusion. The resulting representations are iteratively refined through pretraining tasks. During reasoning, VGWG generates Guided Attention Heatmaps (GAHs) to explicitly model environment-instruction relevance and optimize waypoint selection. Extensive comparative experiments and performance analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ST-Booster outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex, disturbance-prone environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, VR contexts are often highly localized and personalized, limiting the effectiveness of general-purpose LLMs. To address this challenge, we present RAG-VR, the first 3D question-answering system for VR that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which augments an LLM with external knowledge retrieved from a localized knowledge database to improve the answer quality. RAG-VR includes a pipeline for extracting comprehensive knowledge about virtual environments and user conditions for accurate answer generation. To ensure efficient retrieval, RAG-VR offloads the retrieval process to a nearby edge server and uses only essential information during retrieval. Moreover, we train the retriever to effectively distinguish among relevant, irrelevant, and hard-to-differentiate information in relation to questions. RAG-VR improves answer accuracy by 17.9%-41.8% and reduces end-to-end latency by 34.5%-47.3% compared with two baseline systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>GenAI...</summary><p>GenAI-XR 2025 Workshop, co-located with 2025 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR)</p></details> |
| **[A Visual-Inertial Motion Prior SLAM for Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23429v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VI-SLAM) algorithms which are mostly based on static assumption are widely used in fields such as robotics, UAVs, VR, and autonomous driving. To overcome the localization risks caused by dynamic landmarks in most VI-SLAM systems, a robust visual-inertial motion prior SLAM system, named IDY-VINS, is proposed in this paper which effectively handles dynamic landmarks using inertial motion prior for dynamic environments to varying degrees. Specifically, potential dynamic landmarks are preprocessed during the feature tracking phase by the probabilistic model of landmarks' minimum projection errors which are obtained from inertial motion prior and epipolar constraint. Subsequently, a robust and self-adaptive bundle adjustment residual is proposed considering the minimum projection error prior for dynamic candidate landmarks. This residual is integrated into a sliding window based nonlinear optimization process to estimate camera poses, IMU states and landmark positions while minimizing the impact of dynamic candidate landmarks that deviate from the motion prior. Finally, a clean point cloud map without `ghosting effect' is obtained that contains only static landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy and time cost by robustly mitigating the influence of dynamic landmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Planning Framework for UAV-Based Surface Inspection in Partially Unknown Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09294v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspecting indoor environments such as tunnels, industrial facilities, and construction sites is essential for infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. While manual inspection in these environments is often time-consuming and potentially hazardous, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can improve efficiency by autonomously handling inspection tasks. Such inspection tasks usually rely on reference maps for coverage planning. However, in industrial applications, only the floor plans are typically available. The unforeseen obstacles not included in the floor plans will result in outdated reference maps and inefficient or unsafe inspection trajectories. In this work, we propose an adaptive inspection framework that integrates global coverage planning with local reactive adaptation to improve the coverage and efficiency of UAV-based inspection in partially unknown indoor environments. Experimental results in structured indoor scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in inspection efficiency and achieving high coverage rates with adaptive obstacle handling, highlighting its potential for enhancing the efficiency of indoor facility inspection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concurrent-Allocation Task Execution for Multi-Robot Path-Crossing-Minimal Navigation in Obstacle Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09230v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing undesirable path crossings among trajectories of different robots is vital in multi-robot navigation missions, which not only reduces detours and conflict scenarios, but also enhances navigation efficiency and boosts productivity. Despite recent progress in multi-robot path-crossing-minimal (MPCM) navigation, the majority of approaches depend on the minimal squared-distance reassignment of suitable desired points to robots directly. However, if obstacles occupy the passing space, calculating the actual robot-point distances becomes complex or intractable, which may render the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments inefficient or even infeasible. In this paper, the concurrent-allocation task execution (CATE) algorithm is presented to address this problem (i.e., MPCM navigation in obstacle environments). First, the path-crossing-related elements in terms of (i) robot allocation, (ii) desired-point convergence, and (iii) collision and obstacle avoidance are encoded into integer and control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Then, the proposed constraints are used in an online constrained optimization framework, which implicitly yet effectively minimizes the possible path crossings and trajectory length in obstacle environments by minimizing the desired point allocation cost and slack variables in CBF constraints simultaneously. In this way, the MPCM navigation in obstacle environments can be achieved with flexible spatial orderings. Note that the feasibility of solutions and the asymptotic convergence property of the proposed CATE algorithm in obstacle environments are both guaranteed, and the calculation burden is also reduced by concurrently calculating the optimal allocation and the control input directly without the path planning process.</p></details> |  |

With growing demand comes a reduction in rapid development time. Data collection and analysis are essential in agriculture. However, considering a given crop, its cycle comes once a year, and researchers must wait a few months before collecting more data for the given crop. To overcome this hurdle, researchers are venturing into digital twins for agriculture. Toward this effort, we present an agricultural framework(agriFrame). Here, we introduce a simulated greenhouse environment for testing and controlling a robot and remotely controlling/implementing the algorithms in the real-world greenhouse setup.

Traditional wrists struggle to balance these demands, often relying on complex control schemes or complicated mechanical designs to mitigate potential damage from force overload. In response, we present BiFlex, a flexible robotic wrist that uses a soft buckling honeycomb structure to provides a natural bimodal stiffness response. The higher stiffness mode enables precise household object manipulation, while the lower stiffness mode provides the compliance needed to adapt to external forces. We design BiFlex to maintain a fingertip deflection of less than 1 cm while supporting loads up to 500g and create a BiFlex wrist for many grippers, including Panda, Robotiq, and BaRiFlex. We validate BiFlex under several real-world experimental evaluations, including surface wiping, precise pick-and-place, and grasping under environmental constraints. We demonstrate that BiFlex simplifies control while maintaining precise object manipulation and enhanced safety in real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries. Our system is the first of its kind to be deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as MAVs, leveraging vision-language information for real-world robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Predicting the next word in an existing text has turned out to be a powerful signal, at least at scale. But there are signs that we are running out of this resource. In recent months, interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus, both for "alignment" (with a reward model judging the quality of instruction following attempts) and for improving "reasoning" (process- and outcome-based verifiers judging reasoning steps). In this paper, we explore to what extent synthetic interaction in what we call Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can provide a learning signal, and how this signal can be used. We introduce an environment for producing such interaction data (with the help of a Large Language Model as counterpart to the learner model), both offline and online. We investigate the effects of supervised fine-tuning on this data, as well as reinforcement learning setups such as DPO, and GRPO; showing that all of these approaches achieve some improvements in in-domain games, but only GRPO demonstrates the ability to generalise to out-of-domain games as well as retain competitive performance in reference-based tasks. We release the framework and the baseline training setups in the hope that this can foster research in this promising new direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/lm-playpen/playpen Please send correspodence to: lm-playschool@googlegroups.com</p></details> |
| **[The Composite Visual-Laser Navigation Method Applied in Indoor Poultry Farming Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08431v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor poultry farms require inspection robots to maintain precise environmental control, which is crucial for preventing the rapid spread of disease and large-scale bird mortality. However, the complex conditions within these facilities, characterized by areas of intense illumination and water accumulation, pose significant challenges. Traditional navigation methods that rely on a single sensor often perform poorly in such environments, resulting in issues like laser drift and inaccuracies in visual navigation line extraction. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel composite navigation method that integrates both laser and vision technologies. This approach dynamically computes a fused yaw angle based on the real-time reliability of each sensor modality, thereby eliminating the need for physical navigation lines. Experimental validation in actual poultry house environments demonstrates that our method not only resolves the inherent drawbacks of single-sensor systems, but also significantly enhances navigation precision and operational efficiency. As such, it presents a promising solution for improving the performance of inspection robots in complex indoor poultry farming settings.</p></details> |  |

However, a major challenge in adopting secure aggregation approaches for practical applications is the significant computational overhead of the underlying cryptographic protocols, e.g. fully homomorphic encryption. This overhead makes secure aggregation protocols impractical, especially for large datasets. In contrast, hardware-based security techniques such as trusted execution environments (TEEs) enable computation at near-native speeds, making them a promising alternative for reducing the computational burden typically associated with purely cryptographic techniques. Yet, in many scenarios, parties may opt for either cryptographic or hardware-based security mechanisms, highlighting the need for hybrid approaches. In this work, we introduce several secure aggregation architectures that integrate both cryptographic and TEE-based techniques, analyzing the trade-offs between security and performance.</p></details> |  |

To address this, device fingerprinting is often employed to authenticate devices, detect adversaries, and identify eavesdroppers in an environment. This requires the ability to discern between legitimate and malicious devices which is achieved by analyzing the unique physical and/or operational characteristics of IoT devices. In the era of the latest progress in machine learning, particularly generative models, it is crucial to methodically examine the current studies in device fingerprinting. This involves explaining their approaches and underscoring their limitations when faced with adversaries armed with these ML tools. To systematically analyze existing methods, we propose a generic, yet simplified, model for device fingerprinting. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate existing methods to authenticate devices and detect eavesdropping, using our proposed model. We further study trends and similarities between works in authentication and eavesdropping detection and present the existing threats and attacks in these domains. Finally, we discuss future directions in fingerprinting based on these trends to develop more secure IoT fingerprinting schemes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

The PDPPO state transition process is divided into two steps: a deterministic step resulting in the post-decision state and a stochastic step leading to the next state. Our approach incorporates post-decision states and dual critics to reduce the problem's dimensionality and enhance the accuracy of value function estimation. Lot-sizing is a mixed integer programming problem for which we exemplify such dynamics. The objective of lot-sizing is to optimize production, delivery fulfillment, and inventory levels in uncertain demand and cost parameters. This paper evaluates the performance of PDPPO across various environments and configurations. Notably, PDPPO with a dual critic architecture achieves nearly double the maximum reward of vanilla PPO in specific scenarios, requiring fewer episode iterations and demonstrating faster and more consistent learning across different initializations. On average, PDPPO outperforms PPO in environments with a stochastic component in the state transition. These results support the benefits of using a post-decision state. Integrating this post-decision state in the value function approximation leads to more informed and efficient learning in high-dimensional and stochastic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Influential Bandits: Pulling an Arm May Change the Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08200v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While classical formulations of multi-armed bandit problems assume that each arm's reward is independent and stationary, real-world applications often involve non-stationary environments and interdependencies between arms. In particular, selecting one arm may influence the future rewards of other arms, a scenario not adequately captured by existing models such as rotting bandits or restless bandits. To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit problem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric, positive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm losses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds, including a superlinear $\Omega(T^2 / \log^2 T)$ bound for the standard UCB algorithm and an algorithm-independent $\Omega(T)$ bound, which highlight the inherent difficulty of the setting. We then introduce a new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator tailored to the structure of the loss dynamics. Under mild assumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \log T)$, which is nearly optimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon. The algorithm is simple to implement and computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the presence of inter-arm influence and confirm the superior performance of our method compared to conventional bandit algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Taking such aspects into consideration implies porting the LLMs to an on-premise environment, where privacy and security can be controlled. In this paper, we study this porting process of a real-life application using ChatGPT, which runs in a public cloud, to an on-premise environment. The application being ported is AIPA, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and sophisticated data analytics to enhance the assessment of procurement call bids. The main considerations in the porting process include transparency of open source models and cost of hardware, which are central design choices of the on-premise environment. In addition to presenting the porting process, we evaluate downsides and benefits associated with porting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Actua...</summary><p>Actual article is a part of the proceedings of the International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR) 2025</p></details> |

Low-altitude drone missions are effective for collecting fine-grained animal movement and behavior data, particularly if missions are automated for increased speed and consistency. However, little work exists on evaluating computer vision models on low-altitude aerial imagery and generalizability across different species and settings. To fill this gap, we present a novel multi-environment, multi-species, low-altitude aerial footage (MMLA) dataset. MMLA consists of drone footage collected across three diverse environments: Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Mpala Research Centre in Kenya, and The Wilds Conservation Center in Ohio, which includes five species: Plains zebras, Grevy's zebras, giraffes, onagers, and African Painted Dogs. We comprehensively evaluate three YOLO models (YOLOv5m, YOLOv8m, and YOLOv11m) for detecting animals. Results demonstrate significant performance disparities across locations and species-specific detection variations. Our work highlights the importance of evaluating detection algorithms across different environments for robust wildlife monitoring applications using drones.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Contributes to Affective Polarization in Networked Online Environments? Evidence from an Agent-Based Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07610v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affective polarization, or, inter-party hostility, is increasingly recognized as a pervasive issue in democracies worldwide, posing a threat to social cohesion. The digital media ecosystem, now widely accessible and ever-present, has often been implicated in accelerating this phenomenon. However, the precise causal mechanisms responsible for driving affective polarization have been a subject of extensive debate. While the concept of echo chambers, characterized by individuals ensconced within like-minded groups, bereft of counter-attitudinal content, has long been the prevailing hypothesis, accumulating empirical evidence suggests a more nuanced picture. This study aims to contribute to the ongoing debate by employing an agent-based model to illustrate how affective polarization is either fostered or hindered by individual news consumption and dissemination patterns based on ideological alignment. To achieve this, we parameterize three key aspects: (1) The affective asymmetry of individuals' engagement with in-party versus out-party content, (2) The proportion of in-party members within one's social neighborhood, and (3) The degree of partisan bias among the elites within the population. Subsequently, we observe macro-level changes in affective polarization within the population under various conditions stipulated by these parameters. This approach allows us to explore the intricate dynamics of affective polarization within digital environments, shedding light on the interplay between individual behaviors, social networks, and information exposure.</p></details> |  |

This dataset, collected from Sydney and surrounding cities in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, consists of 756 images with high-quality pixel-level annotations. It is designed to assist AV industry and researchers by providing annotated data and tools for algorithm development, testing, and deployment in the Australian context.

| **[Adaptive Vision-Guided Robotic Arm Control for Precision Pruning in Dynamic Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07309v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a vision-guided robotic control system for automated fruit tree pruning applications. Traditional agricultural practices rely on labor-intensive tasks and processes that lack scalability and efficiency, creating a pressing need for automation research to address growing demands for higher crop yields, scalable operations, and reduced manual labor. To this end, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for robust and automated fruit pruning in dense orchards. The proposed algorithm utilizes CoTracker, that is designed to track 2D feature points in video sequences with significant robustness and accuracy, while leveraging joint attention mechanisms to account for inter-point dependencies, enabling robust and precise tracking under challenging and sophisticated conditions. To validate the efficacy of CoTracker, a Universal Robots manipulator UR5e is employed in a Gazebo simulation environment mounted on ClearPath Robotics Warthog robot featuring an Intel RealSense D435 camera. The system achieved a 93% success rate in pruning trials and with an average end trajectory error of 0.23 mm. The vision controller demonstrated robust performance in handling occlusions and maintaining stable trajectories as the arm move towards the target point. The results validate the effectiveness of integrating vision-based tracking with kinematic control for precision agricultural tasks. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and the integration of 3D reconstruction techniques for enhanced adaptability in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world navigation tasks, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration, particularly in cluttered environments with sparse rewards or complex dynamics under system disturbances. To address this challenge, we bridge general graph-based motion planning with DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively and achieve desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense reward function grounded in a graph structure that spans the entire state space. This graph provides rich guidance, steering the agent toward optimal strategies. We validate our approach in challenging environments, demonstrating substantial improvements in exploration efficiency and task success rates.

| **[A Pointcloud Registration Framework for Relocalization in Subterranean Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07231v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relocalization, the process of re-establishing a robot's position within an environment, is crucial for ensuring accurate navigation and task execution when external positioning information, such as GPS, is unavailable or has been lost. Subterranean environments present significant challenges for relocalization due to limited external positioning information, poor lighting that affects camera localization, irregular and often non-distinct surfaces, and dust, which can introduce noise and occlusion in sensor data. In this work, we propose a robust, computationally friendly framework for relocalization through point cloud registration utilizing a prior point cloud map. The framework employs Intrinsic Shape Signatures (ISS) to select feature points in both the target and prior point clouds. The Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) algorithm is utilized to create descriptors for these feature points, and matching these descriptors yields correspondences between the point clouds. A 3D transformation is estimated using the matched points, which initializes a Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration. The transformation result from NDT is further refined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm. This framework enhances registration accuracy even in challenging conditions, such as dust interference and significant initial transformations between the target and source, making it suitable for autonomous robots operating in underground mines and tunnels. This framework was validated with experiments in simulated and real-world mine datasets, demonstrating its potential for improving relocalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2E-Gym: Procedural Environments and Hybrid Verifiers for Scaling Open-Weights SWE Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07164v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving open-source models on real-world SWE tasks (solving GITHUB issues) faces two key challenges: 1) scalable curation of execution environments to train these models, and, 2) optimal scaling of test-time compute. We introduce AgentGym, the largest procedurally-curated executable gym environment for training real-world SWE-agents, consisting of more than 8.7K tasks. AgentGym is powered by two main contributions: 1) SYNGEN: a synthetic data curation recipe that enables scalable curation of executable environments using test-generation and back-translation directly from commits, thereby reducing reliance on human-written issues or unit tests. We show that this enables more scalable training leading to pass@1 performance of 34.4% on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark with our 32B model. 2) Hybrid Test-time Scaling: we provide an in-depth analysis of two test-time scaling axes; execution-based and execution-free verifiers, demonstrating that they exhibit complementary strengths and limitations. Test-based verifiers suffer from low distinguishability, while execution-free verifiers are biased and often rely on stylistic features. Surprisingly, we find that while each approach individually saturates around 42-43%, significantly higher gains can be obtained by leveraging their complementary strengths. Overall, our approach achieves 51% on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE-agents and for the first time showing competitive performance with proprietary models such as o1, o1-preview and sonnet-3.5-v2 (with tools). We will open-source our environments, models, and agent trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://r2e-gym.github.io/</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods that rely on task-specific networks and assumptions about movable parts, our IAAO leverages large foundation models to estimate interactive affordances and part articulations in three stages. We first build hierarchical features and label fields for each object state using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by distilling mask features and view-consistent labels from multi-view images. We then perform object- and part-level queries on the 3D Gaussian primitives to identify static and articulated elements, estimating global transformations and local articulation parameters along with affordances. Finally, scenes from different states are merged and refined based on the estimated transformations, enabling robust affordance-based interaction and manipulation of objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-like compositional learning of visually-grounded concepts using synthetic environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06618v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The compositional structure of language enables humans to decompose complex phrases and map them to novel visual concepts, showcasing flexible intelligence. While several algorithms exhibit compositionality, they fail to elucidate how humans learn to compose concept classes and ground visual cues through trial and error. To investigate this multi-modal learning challenge, we designed a 3D synthetic environment in which an agent learns, via reinforcement, to navigate to a target specified by a natural language instruction. These instructions comprise nouns, attributes, and critically, determiners, prepositions, or both. The vast array of word combinations heightens the compositional complexity of the visual grounding task, as navigating to a blue cube above red spheres is not rewarded when the instruction specifies navigating to "some blue cubes below the red sphere". We first demonstrate that reinforcement learning agents can ground determiner concepts to visual targets but struggle with more complex prepositional concepts. Second, we show that curriculum learning, a strategy humans employ, enhances concept learning efficiency, reducing the required training episodes by 15% in determiner environments and enabling agents to easily learn prepositional concepts. Finally, we establish that agents trained on determiner or prepositional concepts can decompose held-out test instructions and rapidly adapt their navigation policies to unseen visual object combinations. Leveraging synthetic environments, our findings demonstrate that multi-modal reinforcement learning agents can achieve compositional understanding of complex concept classes and highlight the efficacy of human-like learning strategies in improving artificial systems' learning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Dynamic Environments: A Hybrid Approach to Motion Planning for Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06596v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulators operating in dynamic and uncertain environments require efficient motion planning to navigate obstacles while maintaining smooth trajectories. Velocity Potential Field (VPF) planners offer real-time adaptability but struggle with complex constraints and local minima, leading to suboptimal performance in cluttered spaces. Traditional approaches rely on pre-planned trajectories, but frequent recomputation is computationally expensive. This study proposes a hybrid motion planning approach, integrating an improved VPF with a Sampling-Based Motion Planner (SBMP). The SBMP ensures optimal path generation, while VPF provides real-time adaptability to dynamic obstacles. This combination enhances motion planning efficiency, stability, and computational feasibility, addressing key challenges in uncertain environments such as warehousing and surgical robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Navigation in Uncertain Crowded Environments Using Risk Adaptive CVaR Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06513v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation in dynamic, crowded environments poses a significant challenge due to the inherent uncertainties in the obstacle model. In this work, we propose a risk-adaptive approach based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk Barrier Function (CVaR-BF), where the risk level is automatically adjusted to accept the minimum necessary risk, achieving a good performance in terms of safety and optimization feasibility under uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic zone-based barrier function which characterizes the collision likelihood by evaluating the relative state between the robot and the obstacle. By integrating risk adaptation with this new function, our approach adaptively expands the safety margin, enabling the robot to proactively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic environments. Comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing social navigation approaches, and validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep RL-based Autonomous Navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in a complex GPS-denied Indoor Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05918v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in indoor environments poses significant challenges due to the lack of reliable GPS signals in enclosed spaces such as warehouses, factories, and indoor facilities. Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are preferred for navigating in these complex, GPS-denied scenarios because of their agility, low power consumption, and limited computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning based Deep-Proximal Policy Optimization (D-PPO) algorithm to enhance realtime navigation through improving the computation efficiency. The end-to-end network is trained in 3D realistic meta-environments created using the Unreal Engine. With these trained meta-weights, the MAV system underwent extensive experimental trials in real-world indoor environments. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces computational latency by 91\% during training period without significant degradation in performance. The algorithm was tested on a DJI Tello drone, yielding similar results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Momentum Boosted Episodic Memory for Improving Learning in Long-Tailed RL Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05840v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms assume the distribution of the data to be uniform or mostly uniform. However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneTAP: Scene-Coherent Typographic Adversarial Planner against Vision-Language Models in Real-World Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00114v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual content. While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

The platform also defines ten categories of tools for agent-driven task solving and evaluates seven leading LLMs, revealing that while models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet can achieve a 67.1% task completion rate in routine settings, they still struggle with complex task understanding and tool coordination, limiting their capacity to serve as the central core of automated radiology systems. By incorporating four advanced prompt engineering strategies--where prompt-backpropagation and multi-agent collaboration contributed 16.8% and 30.7% improvements, respectively--the performance for complex tasks was enhanced by 48.2% overall. Furthermore, automated tool building was explored to improve robustness, achieving a 65.4% success rate, thereby offering promising insights for the future integration of fully automated radiology applications into clinical practice.

These aim to streamline and enhance the user interaction and collaboration process during drone navigation, ultimately expediting mission success and accommodating users' inputs. In this paper, we present a novel human-drone mixed reality interface that aims to (a) increase human-drone spatial awareness by sharing relevant spatial information and representations between the human equipped with a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and the robot and (b) enable safer and intuitive human-drone interactive and collaborative navigation in unknown environments beyond the simple command and control or teleoperation paradigm. We validate our framework through extensive user studies and experiments in a simulated post-disaster scenario, comparing its performance against a traditional First-Person View (FPV) control systems. Furthermore, multiple tests on several users underscore the advantages of the proposed solution, which offers intuitive and natural interaction with the system. This demonstrates the solution's ability to assist humans during a drone navigation mission, ensuring its safe and effective execution.</p></details> | Approved at ICUAS 25 |
| **[The Role of Environment Access in Agnostic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05405v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with large state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient learning. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider the weakest possible form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, where the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task. Although it is known that sample-efficient agnostic policy learning is not possible in the standard online RL setting without further assumptions, we investigate the extent to which this can be overcome with stronger forms of access to the environment. Specifically, we show that: 1. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given access to a local simulator, from which one can reset to any previously seen state. This result holds even when the policy class is realizable, and stands in contrast to a positive result of [MFR24] showing that value-based learning under realizability is tractable with local simulator access. 2. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given online access to a reset distribution with good coverage properties over the state space (the so-called $\mu$-reset setting). We also study stronger forms of function approximation for policy learning, showing that PSDP [BKSN03] and CPI [KL02] provably fail in the absence of policy completeness. 3. On a positive note, agnostic policy learning is statistically tractable for Block MDPs with access to both of the above reset models. We establish this via a new algorithm that carefully constructs a policy emulator: a tabular MDP with a small state space that approximates the value functions of all policies $\pi \in \Pi$. These values are approximated without any explicit value function class.</p></details> | comments welcome |

We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain and dynamic environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. To ensure reproducibility, each task includes dedicated initialization, success-checking, and tear-down logic, which modifies and inspects the device's system state. We experiment with baseline agents to test AndroidWorld and provide initial results on the benchmark. Our best agent can complete 30.6% of AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-platform agents. Finally, we also conduct a robustness analysis, showing that task variations can significantly affect agent performance, demonstrating that without such testing, agent performance metrics may not fully reflect practical challenges.

We consider the scenario where real-time perception feedback (e.g., LiDAR) is used online to construct a local CBF that models local state constraints (e.g., local safety constraints such as obstacles) in the a priori unmapped environment. The approach employs a soft-maximum function to synthesize a single time-varying CBF from the N most recently obtained local CBFs. Next, the input constraints are transformed into controller-state constraints through the use of control dynamics. Then, we use a soft-minimum function to compose the input constraints with the time-varying CBF that models the a priori unmapped environment. This composition yields a single relaxed CBF, which is used in a constrained optimization to obtain an optimal control that satisfies the state and input constraints. The approach is validated through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot that is equipped with LiDAR and navigates an unmapped environment. The robot successfully navigates the environment while avoiding the a priori unmapped obstacles and satisfying both speed and input constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Preprint was submitted to the 2025 Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.01458</p></details> |

While prior works have explored learning-based synergies between pushing and grasping for two-fingered grippers, few have leveraged the high degrees of freedom (DoF) in dexterous hands to perform efficient singulation for grasping in cluttered settings. In this work, we introduce DexSinGrasp, a unified policy for dexterous object singulation and grasping. DexSinGrasp enables high-dexterity object singulation to facilitate grasping, significantly improving efficiency and effectiveness in cluttered environments. We incorporate clutter arrangement curriculum learning to enhance success rates and generalization across diverse clutter conditions, while policy distillation enables a deployable vision-based grasping strategy. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a set of cluttered grasping tasks with varying object arrangements and occlusion levels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines in both efficiency and grasping success rate, particularly in dense clutter.

Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Robot Control in Dynamic Environments Using Belief Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04097v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments can be challenging due to factors such as unmodeled dynamics, noisy sensor measurements, and partial observability. To account for these limitations, it is common to maintain a belief distribution over the true state. This belief could be a non-parametric, sample-based representation to capture uncertainty more flexibly. In this paper, we propose a novel form of Belief Control Barrier Functions (BCBFs) specifically designed to ensure safety in dynamic environments under stochastic dynamics and a sample-based belief about the environment state. Our approach incorporates provable concentration bounds on tail risk measures into BCBFs, effectively addressing possible multimodal and skewed belief distributions represented by samples. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness against distributional shifts up to a predefined bound. We validate the effectiveness and real-time performance (approximately 1kHz) of the proposed method through two simulated underwater robotic applications: object tracking and dynamic collision avoidance.</p></details> |  |

Within VR experiences, numerous applications rely on the user's voice as a key element of interaction, including music performances and public speaking applications. Self-perception of our voice plays a crucial role in vocal production. When singing or speaking, our voice interacts with the acoustic properties of the environment, shaping the adjustment of vocal parameters in response to the perceived characteristics of the space. This technical report presents a real-time auralization pipeline that leverages three-dimensional Spatial Impulse Responses (SIRs) for multimodal research applications in VR requiring first-person vocal interaction. It describes the impulse response creation and rendering workflow, the audio-visual integration, and addresses latency and computational considerations. The system enables users to explore acoustic spaces from various positions and orientations within a predefined area, supporting three and five Degrees of Freedom (3Dof and 5DoF) in audio-visual multimodal perception for both research and creative applications in VR.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional SLAM systems, which assume static scenes, our approach integrates depth and uncertainty information to enhance tracking, mapping, and rendering performance in the presence of moving objects. We introduce an uncertainty map, predicted by a shallow multi-layer perceptron and DINOv2 features, to guide dynamic object removal during both tracking and mapping. This uncertainty map enhances dense bundle adjustment and Gaussian map optimization, improving reconstruction accuracy. Our system is evaluated on multiple datasets and demonstrates artifact-free view synthesis. Results showcase WildGS-SLAM's superior performance in dynamic environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Building upon the dynamic window approach, the proposed method utilizes gradient information of obstacle distances as a new cost term to anticipate potential collisions. This enhancement enables the robot to improve awareness of obstacles, including those with non-convex shapes. The gradient field is derived from the Gaussian process distance field, which generates both the distance field and gradient field by leveraging Gaussian process regression to model the spatial structure of the environment. Through several obstacle avoidance and fleet collision avoidance scenarios, the proposed GF-DWA is shown to outperform other popular trajectory planning and control methods in terms of safety and flexibility, especially in complex environments with non-convex obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper introduces AMP4EC, an Adaptive Model Partitioning framework designed to optimize deep learning inference in edge environments through real-time resource monitoring, dynamic model partitioning, and adaptive task scheduling. AMP4EC features a resource-aware model partitioner that splits deep learning models based on device capabilities, a task scheduler that ensures efficient load balancing using a weighted scoring mechanism, and a Docker-based deployment environment for validation. Experimental results show up to a 78% reduction in latency and a 414% improvement in throughput compared to baseline methods. The framework achieves consistent performance with low scheduling overhead across varying resource profiles, demonstrating adaptability in high-resource (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) and low-resource (0.4 CPU, 512MB RAM) scenarios. These results highlight AMP4EC's scalability, efficiency, and robustness for real-world edge deployments, addressing the critical need for efficient distributed inference in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted for oral presentation at FMEC 2025</p></details> |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomy Architectures for Safe Planning in Unknown Environments Under Budget Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03001v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mission planning can often be formulated as a constrained control problem under multiple path constraints (i.e., safety constraints) and budget constraints (i.e., resource expenditure constraints). In a priori unknown environments, verifying that an offline solution will satisfy the constraints for all time can be difficult, if not impossible. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose an online method, building on our previous work "gatekeeper", to guarantee safety and satisfy budget constraints of the system trajectory at all times throughout a mission. 2) Next, we prove that our algorithm is recursively feasible and correct. 3) Finally, instead of using a heuristically designed backup controller, we propose a sampling-based method to construct backup trajectories that both minimize resource expenditure and reach budget renewal sets, in which path constraints are satisfied and the constrained resources are renewed. We demonstrate our approach in simulation with a fixed-wing UAV in a GNSS-denied environment with a budget constraint on localization error that can be renewed at visual landmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/dcherenson/gatekeeper_budget_constraints</p></details> |
| **[Exploration-Driven Generative Interactive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02515v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern world models require costly and time-consuming collection of large video datasets with action demonstrations by people or by environment-specific agents. To simplify training, we focus on using many virtual environments for inexpensive, automatically collected interaction data. Genie, a recent multi-environment world model, demonstrates simulation abilities of many environments with shared behavior. Unfortunately, training their model requires expensive demonstrations. Therefore, we propose a training framework merely using a random agent in virtual environments. While the model trained in this manner exhibits good controls, it is limited by the random exploration possibilities. To address this limitation, we propose AutoExplore Agent - an exploration agent that entirely relies on the uncertainty of the world model, delivering diverse data from which it can learn the best. Our agent is fully independent of environment-specific rewards and thus adapts easily to new environments. With this approach, the pretrained multi-environment model can quickly adapt to new environments achieving video fidelity and controllability improvement. In order to obtain automatically large-scale interaction datasets for pretraining, we group environments with similar behavior and controls. To this end, we annotate the behavior and controls of 974 virtual environments - a dataset that we name RetroAct. For building our model, we first create an open implementation of Genie - GenieRedux and apply enhancements and adaptations in our version GenieRedux-G. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/insait-institute/GenieRedux.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

First, a rapid environment preprocessing method is introduced to provide environmental information for subsequent exploration planning. Then, the whole exploration space is divided into multiple subregion cells, each with varying levels of detail. The subregion cells are capable of decomposition and updating online, effectively characterizing dynamic unknown regions with variable resolution. Finally, the hierarchical planning strategy treats subregions as basic planning units and computes an efficient global coverage path. Guided by the global path, the local path that sequentially visits the viewpoint set is refined to provide an executable path for the robot. This hierarchical planning from coarse to fine steps reduces the complexity of the planning scheme while improving exploration efficiency. The proposed method is compared with state-of-art methods in benchmark environments. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency in completing exploration while using lower computational resources.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive research, challenges remain due to the diverse shapes and properties of target objects, inaccuracies in sensing, and potential collisions with the environment. In this work, we propose a method for effectively grasping in cluttered bin-picking environments where these challenges intersect. We utilize a multi-functional gripper that combines both suction and finger grasping to handle a wide range of objects. We also present an active gripper adaptation strategy to minimize collisions between the gripper hardware and the surrounding environment by actively leveraging the reciprocating suction cup and reconfigurable finger motion. To fully utilize the gripper's capabilities, we built a neural network that detects suction and finger grasp points from a single input RGB-D image. This network is trained using a larger-scale synthetic dataset generated from simulation. In addition to this, we propose an efficient approach to constructing a real-world dataset that facilitates grasp point detection on various objects with diverse characteristics. Experiment results show that the proposed method can grasp objects in cluttered bin-picking scenarios and prevent collisions with environmental constraints such as a corner of the bin. Our proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness in the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024.</p></details> | 11 pages, 14 figures |

Virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can serve as psychological countermeasures as they can digitally simulate immersive environments, interactive companions, and therapeutic experiences. Our study employs a scoping literature review approach to identify what is currently known about the use and effectiveness of VR and AI-based interventions as psychological countermeasures to improve mood or emotional states in adults in space or other ICEs. Additionally, this review aimed to identify gaps in the knowledge base and whether a systematic review with meta-analysis was warranted. The review included studies where the intervention was used or intended for use in space or other extraterrestrial environments (ICE). Our search strategy yielded 19 studies from 3390 records across seven major databases. All studies focused on VR-based interventions, with no eligible AI-based intervention studies found. VR interventions were found to be effective for relaxation and improving mood, emergency training, as an interactive communication platform, for comparing interior designs, and for enhancing exercise. There were improvements for measures of mood and emotion\n (e.g., anxiety and stress); however, user preferences varied, and some instances of cybersickness were reported. A systematic review with meta-analysis is not recommended due to the heterogeneity of results. There is significant scope for further research into the use of VR for a wider range of mood and emotion variables using standardised assessment instruments. Additionally, the potential application of AI as a psychological countermeasure warrants further investigation.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Existing works either assume known environments, target specific dynamics models, or use a-priori valid CBFs, and are thus limited in their safety guarantees for general systems during exploration. We present a method for safely exploring the unknown environment by incrementally composing a global CBF from locally-learned CBFs. The challenge here is that local CBFs may not have well-defined end behavior outside their training domain, i.e. local CBFs may be positive (indicating safety) in regions where no training data is available. We show that well-defined end behavior can be obtained when local CBFs are parameterized by compactly-supported radial basis functions. For learning local CBFs, we collect sensor data, e.g. LiDAR capturing obstacles in the environment, and augment it with simulated data from a safe oracle controller. Our work complements recent efforts to learn CBFs from safe demonstrations -- where learned safe sets are limited to their training domains -- by demonstrating how to grow the safe set over time as more data becomes available. We evaluate our approach on two simulated systems, where our method successfully explores an unknown environment while maintaining safety throughout the entire execution.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce ForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four configurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for various sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or SuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable pose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints - just 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a 10{\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue significantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a transformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates relative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On challenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative pose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming direct-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes. Despite using only 10% of the dataset for training, ForestVO maintains competitive performance with TartanVO while being a significantly lighter model. This work establishes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline specifically tailored for visual odometry in forested environments, leveraging forest-specific training data to optimise feature correspondence and pose estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models.</p></details> |  |

However, the large data centres where cloud computing services are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components. This issue is exacerbated by the increasing deployment of large artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often rely on distributed data centres, thereby significantly impacting the global environment. This study proposes the COUNTER model, designed for sustainable cloud resource management. COUNTER is integrated with cluster graph neural networks and evaluated in a simulated cloud environment, aiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining quality of service parameters. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in resource utilisation, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness compared to the baseline model, HUNTER, which employs a gated graph neural network aimed at achieving carbon neutrality in cloud computing for modern ICT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version accepted at IEEE ICDCS 2025</p></details> |

However, their potential to homogenize human values poses critical risks, similar to biodiversity loss undermining ecological resilience. Rooted in the ancient Greek concept of ethos, meaning both individual character and the shared moral fabric of communities, EthosGPT draws on a tradition that spans from Aristotle's virtue ethics to Adam Smith's moral sentiments as the ethical foundation of economic cooperation. These traditions underscore the vital role of value diversity in fostering social trust, institutional legitimacy, and long-term prosperity. EthosGPT addresses the challenge of value homogenization by introducing an open-source framework for mapping and evaluating LLMs within a global scale of human values. Using international survey data on cultural indices, prompt-based assessments, and comparative statistical analyses, EthosGPT reveals both the adaptability and biases of LLMs across regions and cultures. It offers actionable insights for developing inclusive LLMs, such as diversifying training data and preserving endangered cultural heritage to ensure representation in AI systems. These contributions align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11.4 (Cultural Heritage Preservation), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Through interdisciplinary collaboration, EthosGPT promotes AI systems that are both technically robust and ethically inclusive, advancing value plurality as a cornerstone for sustainable and equitable futures.</p></details> |  |

Many digital services and products either leverage or entirely rely on FOSS in their software stack. FOSS sustainability is a multifaceted concept, and the impact of its decline on community products is less known. In this study, we sought to understand how the different aspects of FOSS sustainability impact software quality from a life-cycle perspective. Specifically, we investigate whether and how support and incubation of FOSS projects or bypassing incubation correlate with software quality outcomes. We selected 342 FOSS projects from the Apache Software Foundation that have either graduated, retired, or bypassed their incubator program. We used 16 sustainability metrics to examine their impact on eight software quality metrics. Using Bayesian data analysis, we found that our selected sustainability metrics exhibit distinct relationships with software quality across different project trajectories. Graduated projects showed the strongest sustainability-software quality (SWQ) relationship, both during and post-incubation. In contrast, retired projects showed weaker relationships, despite receiving similar governance support. Bypassed projects, while not outperforming graduated ones, showed comparable sustainability-SWQ relationships. While structured incubation strengthens sustainability and SWQ in graduated projects, retired projects struggle to maintain strong sustainability-SWQ relationships, indicating that additional factors internal and specific to projects influence sustainability. This effect was evident among bypassed projects; their self-reliant sustainability practices yielded stronger sustainability-SWQ compared to the retired ones.</p></details> |  |

Integrating sustainability into TRS has become essential with the increasing need to balance environmental impact, local community interests, and visitor satisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing TRS for sustainable city trips using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a modified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We enhance the traditional RAG system by incorporating a sustainability metric based on a city's popularity and seasonal demand during the prompt augmentation phase. This modification, called Sustainability Augmented Reranking (SAR), ensures the system's recommendations align with sustainability goals. Evaluations using popular open-source LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, demonstrate that the SAR-enhanced approach consistently matches or outperforms the baseline (without SAR) across most metrics, highlighting the benefits of incorporating sustainability into TRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the RecSoGood 2024 Workshop co-located with the 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a pioneering paradigm of mobile edge quantum computing (MEQC) that integrates quantum computing capabilities into classical edge computing servers that are proximate to mobile devices. To conceptualize the MEQC, we first design an MEQC system, where mobile devices can offload classical and quantum computation tasks to edge servers equipped with classical and quantum computers. We then formulate the hybrid classical-quantum computation offloading problem whose goal is to minimize system cost in terms of latency and energy consumption. To solve the offloading problem efficiently, we propose a hybrid discrete-continuous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to learn long-term sustainable offloading and partitioning strategies. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the MEQC system cost by up to 30% compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.06681</p></details> |

Coupled with a mass consumption society, there is a risk of detrimental social outcomes and threats to democracy, such as misinformation and political polarization. But AI, robotics and other emerging technologies could also provide a transition to community-based economies, in which more democratic, egalitarian, and sustainable value circulations can be established. Based on both a review of case studies, and our own experiments in Detroit, we derive three core principles for the use of computing in community-based economies. The prefigurative principle requires that the development process itself incorporates equity goals, rather than viewing equity as something to be achieved in the future. The generative principle requires the prevention of value extraction, and its replacement by circulations in which value is returned back to the aspects of labor, nature, and society by which it is generated. And third, the solidarity principle requires that deployments at all scales and across all domains support both individual freedoms and opportunities for mutual aid. Thus we propose the use of computational technologies to develop a specifically generative form of community-based economy: one that is egalitarian regarding race, class and gender; sustainable both environmentally and socially; and democratic in the deep sense of putting people in control of their own lives and livelihoods.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder for Efficient and Sustainable Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06320v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digitalization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |

Using agentic AI frameworks in geospatial applications can amass thousands of dollars in API charges or requires expensive, power-intensive GPUs for deployment, creating barriers for researchers, policymakers, and NGOs. Unfortunately, when geospatial Copilots are deployed with open language models (OLMs), performance often degrades due to their dependence on GPT-optimized logic. In this paper, we present Geo-OLM, a tool-augmented geospatial agent that leverages the novel paradigm of state-driven LLM reasoning to decouple task progression from tool calling. By alleviating the workflow reasoning burden, our approach enables low-resource OLMs to complete geospatial tasks more effectively. When downsizing to small models below 7B parameters, Geo-OLM outperforms the strongest prior geospatial baselines by 32.8% in successful query completion rates. Our method performs comparably to proprietary models achieving results within 10% of GPT-4o, while reducing inference costs by two orders of magnitude from \$500-\$1000 to under \$10. We present an in-depth analysis with geospatial downstream benchmarks, providing key insights to help practitioners effectively deploy OLMs for EO applications.</p></details> |  |

Model quantization has emerged as a key technique to enable efficient LLM inference by reducing model size and computational overhead. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 28 quantized LLMs from the Ollama library, which applies by default Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and weight-only quantization techniques, deployed on an edge device (Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM). We evaluate energy efficiency, inference performance, and output accuracy across multiple quantization levels and task types. Models are benchmarked on five standardized datasets (CommonsenseQA, BIG-Bench Hard, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval), and we employ a high-resolution, hardware-based energy measurement tool to capture real-world power consumption. Our findings reveal the trade-offs between energy efficiency, inference speed, and accuracy in different quantization settings, highlighting configurations that optimize LLM deployment for resource-constrained environments. By integrating hardware-level energy profiling with LLM benchmarking, this study provides actionable insights for sustainable AI, bridging a critical gap in existing research on energy-aware LLM deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Toward a Sustainable Low-Altitude Economy: A Survey of Energy-Efficient RIS-UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02162v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of RIS into UAV networks presents a transformative solution for achieving energy-efficient and reliable communication, particularly within the rapidly expanding low-altitude economy (LAE). As UAVs facilitate diverse aerial services-spanning logistics to smart surveillance-their limited energy reserves create significant challenges. RIS effectively addresses this issue by dynamically shaping the wireless environment to enhance signal quality, reduce power consumption, and extend UAV operation time, thus enabling sustainable and scalable deployment across various LAE applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of RIS-assisted UAV networks, focusing on energy-efficient design within LAE applications. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RIS, covering its operational modes, deployment architectures, and roles in both terrestrial and aerial environments. Next, advanced EE-driven strategies for integrating RIS and UAVs. Techniques such as trajectory optimization, power control, beamforming, and dynamic resource management are examined. Emphasis is placed on collaborative solutions that incorporate UAV-mounted RIS, wireless energy harvesting (EH), and intelligent scheduling frameworks. We further categorize RIS-enabled schemes based on key performance objectives relevant to LAE scenarios. These objectives include sum rate maximization, coverage extension, QoS guarantees, secrecy rate improvement, latency reduction, and age of information (AoI) minimization. The survey also delves into RIS-UAV synergy with emerging technologies like MEC, NOMA, V2X communication, and WPT. These technologies are crucial to the LAE ecosystem. Finally, we outline open research challenges and future directions, emphasizing the critical role of energy-aware, RIS-enhanced UAV networks in shaping scalable, sustainable, and intelligent infrastructures within the LAE.</p></details> | 25, 7 |
| **[Repetitions are not all alike: distinct mechanisms sustain repetition in language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01100v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text generated by language models (LMs) can degrade into repetitive cycles, where identical word sequences are persistently repeated one after another. Prior research has typically treated repetition as a unitary phenomenon. However, repetitive sequences emerge under diverse tasks and contexts, raising the possibility that it may be driven by multiple underlying factors. Here, we experimentally explore the hypothesis that repetition in LMs can result from distinct mechanisms, reflecting different text generation strategies used by the model. We examine the internal working of LMs under two conditions that prompt repetition: one in which repeated sequences emerge naturally after human-written text, and another where repetition is explicitly induced through an in-context learning (ICL) setup. Our analysis reveals key differences between the two conditions: the model exhibits varying levels of confidence, relies on different attention heads, and shows distinct pattens of change in response to controlled perturbations. These findings suggest that distinct internal mechanisms can interact to drive repetition, with implications for its interpretation and mitigation strategies. More broadly, our results highlight that the same surface behavior in LMs may be sustained by different underlying processes, acting independently or in combination.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap: Integrating Ethics and Environmental Sustainability in AI Research and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00797v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the possibilities for Artificial Intelligence (AI) have grown, so have concerns regarding its impacts on society and the environment. However, these issues are often raised separately; i.e. carbon footprint analyses of AI models typically do not consider how the pursuit of scale has contributed towards building models that are both inaccessible to most researchers in terms of cost and disproportionately harmful to the environment. On the other hand, model audits that aim to evaluate model performance and disparate impacts mostly fail to engage with the environmental ramifications of AI models and how these fit into their auditing approaches. In this separation, both research directions fail to capture the depth of analysis that can be explored by considering the two in parallel and the potential solutions for making informed choices that can be developed at their convergence. In this essay, we build upon work carried out in AI and in sister communities, such as philosophy and sustainable development, to make more deliberate connections around topics such as generalizability, transparency, evaluation and equity across AI research and practice. We argue that the efforts aiming to study AI's ethical ramifications should be made in tandem with those evaluating its impacts on the environment, and we conclude with a proposal of best practices to better integrate AI ethics and sustainability in AI research and practice.</p></details> |  |

This decentralized approach involves multiple clients or silos, collaboratively training a global model under the coordination of a central server while utilizing their private local data. Unlike traditional methods that necessitate data sharing and transmission, Cross-Silo FL allows clients to share model updates rather than raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. Despite its growing adoption, the carbon impact associated with Cross-Silo FL remains poorly understood due to the limited research in this area. This study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the sustainability of Cross-Silo FL throughout the entire AI product lifecycle, extending the analysis beyond the model training phase alone. We systematically compare this decentralized method with traditional centralized approaches and present a robust quantitative framework for assessing the costs and CO2 emissions in real-world Cross-Silo FL environments. Our findings indicate that the energy consumption and costs of model training are comparable between Cross-Silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning. However, the additional data transfer and storage requirements inherent in Centralized Learning can result in significant, often overlooked CO2 emissions. Moreover, we introduce an innovative data and application management system that integrates Cross-Silo FL and analytics, aiming at improving the sustainability and economic efficiency of IT enterprises.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Sophia Summit 2023</p></details> |

Popular training enrichment approaches like model enlargement or massive data gathering are expensive and environmentally unsustainable, thus we seek to provide better visual explanations to RS aligning with the principles of Responsible AI. In this work, we research the intersection of effective and sustainable training enrichment strategies for visual-based RS explainability models by developing three novel strategies that focus on training Data Quality: 1) selection of reliable negative training examples using Positive-unlabelled Learning, 2) transform-based data augmentation, and 3) text-to-image generative-based data augmentation. The integration of these strategies in three state-of-the-art explainability models increases 5% the performance in relevant ranking metrics of these visual-based RS explainability models without penalizing their practical long-term sustainability, as tested in multiple real-world restaurant recommendation explanation datasets.</p></details> |  |

By 2030, urban farming, including Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and vertical farming, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% from 2024 to 2030, according to market reports. This growth is fueled by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, sustainable innovations such as smart growing systems, and the rising interest in green interior design. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates computer vision, machine learning (ML), and environmental sensing for the automated monitoring of plant health and growth. Unlike previous approaches, this framework combines RGB imagery, plant phenotyping data, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, to predict plant water stress in a controlled growth environment. The system utilizes high-resolution cameras to extract phenotypic features, such as RGB, plant area, height, and width while employing the Lag-Llama time series model to analyze and predict water stress. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RGB, size ratios, and environmental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy, with the Fine-tuned model achieving the lowest errors (MSE = 0.420777, MAE = 0.595428) and reduced uncertainty. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data and intelligent systems to automate plant care, optimize resource consumption, and align indoor gardening with sustainable building management practices, paving the way for resilient, green urban spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3ce)</p></details> |

The introduced model is described in detail, with a focus on its modular structure, and proposes various configurations that include various building insulation, heating methods, occupancy patterns, and weather data to analyze different scenarios, and the energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and heating costs are compared and analyzed across 36 introduced scenarios. The thermodynamic behavior of the model is shown to be consistent with real-world conditions, and the comparison of the scenarios concludes that the use of heat pumps for indoor heating in well-insulated buildings has significant economic and sustainability benefits, whereas the use of natural gas-fueled boilers is more cost-effective for buildings with low energy ratings.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages plus 2 pages of supplemental material</p></details> |
| **[Towards Datacenter Environmental Sustainability Using Carbon Depreciation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04976v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the growing need for increasingly capable computing resources to be available on-demand has led to the prosperity of data centers. These data centers have led to several challenges and opportunities to address the environmental impacts from this computing resource. Conventional thinking has been concerned with minimizing energy usage of data centers to address sustainability. However, due to energy efficiency trends and renewable energy integration, recent evidence has demonstrated that embodied carbon is increasingly important and calls for improvements in data center provisioning strategies. In this paper we propose to adopt carbon depreciation models to better encourage the longer lifetime of hardware in the data center. Carbon depreciation models apply a higher proportion of embodied carbon to newly provisioned servers. This promotes provisioning fewer new servers to service jobs only with strict quality-of-service (QoS) constraints and extending lifetime of existing servers whose embodied carbon has already been mostly recovered. Along with carbon depreciation, we make the case that both embodied and operational carbon from server idle time must also be recovered during active jobs. This promotes provisioning strategies that maintain high rates of utilization. We show that prior carbon accounting strategies are counterproductive for sustainability with a greedy job scheduler that attempts to minimize carbon under QoS constraints as they price jobs as 25% cheaper on new versus old hardware. Our approach uses a greedy scheduler that prefers older hardware due to non-linear carbon depreciation promoting sustainable provisioning. Our approach reduces carbon by between 28--57% depending on assumptions for server lifetimes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

Validation of the Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability Perceptions Inventory (AISPI)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15585v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability initiatives increasingly intersect, understanding public perceptions of their relationship becomes crucial for successful implementation. However, no validated instrument exists to measure these specific perceptions. This paper presents the development and validation of the Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability Perceptions Inventory (AISPI), a novel 13-item instrument measuring how individuals view the relationship between AI advancement and environmental sustainability. Through factor analysis (N=105), we identified two distinct dimensions: Twin Transition and Competing Interests. The instrument demonstrated strong reliability (alpha=.89) and construct validity through correlations with established measures of AI and sustainability attitudes. Our findings suggest that individuals can simultaneously recognize both synergies and tensions in the AI-sustainability relationship, offering important implications for researchers and practitioners working at this critical intersection. This work provides a foundational tool for future research on public perceptions of AI's role in sustainable development.</p></details> | <details><summary>CHI 2...</summary><p>CHI 2025 Late Breaking Work</p></details> |

These recent ML methods are often compute hungry, energy intensive, and result in significant green house gas emissions, a known driver of anthropogenic climate change. Additionally, the platforms on which ML systems run are associated with environmental impacts that go beyond the energy consumption driven carbon emissions. The primary solution lionized by both industry and the ML community to improve the environmental sustainability of ML is to increase the compute and energy efficiency with which ML systems operate. In this perspective, we argue that it is time to look beyond efficiency in order to make ML more environmentally sustainable. We present three high-level discrepancies between the many variables that influence the efficiency of ML and the environmental sustainability of ML. Firstly, we discuss how compute efficiency does not imply energy efficiency or carbon efficiency. Second, we present the unexpected effects of efficiency on operational emissions throughout the ML model life cycle. And, finally, we explore the broader environmental impacts that are not accounted by efficiency. These discrepancies show as to why efficiency alone is not enough to remedy the adverse environmental impacts of ML. Instead, we argue for systems thinking as the next step towards holistically improving the environmental sustainability of ML.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Communications of the ACM; 24 pages; 6 figures</p></details> |

Why it does not make sense to move faster when heading the wrong way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17702v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently considered a sustainability "game-changer" within and outside of academia. In order to discuss sustainable AI this article draws from insights by critical data and algorithm studies, STS, transformative sustainability science, critical computer science, and public interest theory. I argue that while there are indeed many sustainability-related use cases for AI, they are likely to have more overall drawbacks than benefits. To substantiate this claim, I differentiate three 'AI materialities' of the AI supply chain: first the literal materiality (e.g. water, cobalt, lithium, energy consumption etc.), second, the informational materiality (e.g. lots of data and centralised control necessary), and third, the social materiality (e.g. exploitative data work, communities harm by waste and pollution). In all materialities, effects are especially devastating for the global south while benefiting the global north. A second strong claim regarding sustainable AI circles around so called apolitical optimisation (e.g. regarding city traffic), however the optimisation criteria (e.g. cars, bikes, emissions, commute time, health) are purely political and have to be collectively negotiated before applying AI optimisation. Hence, sustainable AI, in principle, cannot break the glass ceiling of transformation and might even distract from necessary societal change. To address that I propose to stop 'unformation gathering' and to apply the 'small is beautiful' principle. This aims to contribute to an informed academic and collective negotiation on how to (not) integrate AI into the sustainability project while avoiding to reproduce the status quo by serving hegemonic interests between useful AI use cases, techno-utopian salvation narratives, technology-centred efficiency paradigms, the exploitative and extractivist character of AI and concepts of digital degrowth.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Routing data efficiently within these networks is essential for maintaining a high quality of service. However, current routing strategies, such as bent-pipe and inter-satellite link (ISL) routing, have their unique challenges. The bent-pipe strategy requires a dense deployment of dedicated ground stations, while the ISL-based strategy can negatively impact satellite battery lifespan due to increased traffic load, leading to sustainability issues. In this paper, we propose sustainable collaborative offloading, a framework that orchestrates groups of existing commercial resources like ground stations and 5G base stations for data offloading. This orchestration enhances total capacity, overcoming the limitations of a single resource. We propose the collaborator group set construction algorithm to construct candidate groups and the collaborator selection and total payment algorithm to select offloading targets and determine payments no less than the costs. Extensive real-world-based simulations show that our solution significantly improves energy consumption, satellite service life, and end-to-end latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preliminary extended version of the paper accepted to INFOCOM 2025</p></details> |

While important general guidelines have been established globally regarding the opportunities and challenges that this interdisciplinary research offers, it is essential to generate local reflections from the specific contexts and realities of each region. Hence, this document aims to analyze the scope of this research area from a perspective focused on Colombia and the Neotropics. In this paper, we summarize the main experiences and debates that took place at the Humboldt Institute between 2023 and 2024 in Colombia. To illustrate the variety of promising opportunities, we present current uses such as automatic species identification from images and recordings, species modeling, and in silico bioprospecting, among others. From the experiences described above, we highlight limitations, challenges, and opportunities for in order to successfully implementate AI in conservation efforts and sustainable management of biological resources in the Neotropics. The result aims to be a guide for researchers, decision makers, and biodiversity managers, facilitating the understanding of how artificial intelligence can be effectively integrated into conservation and sustainable use strategies. Furthermore, it also seeks to open a space for dialogue on the development of policies that promote the responsible and ethical adoption of AI in local contexts, ensuring that its benefits are harnessed without compromising biodiversity or the cultural and ecosystemic values inherent in Colombia and the Neotropics.</p></details> |  |

This allows the identification of specific fintech tools that can be selected to mitigate financial risks. The intention is to retrieve the financial transactions and private information of stakeholders involved in the supply chain to construct a knowledge base and a digital twin representation that can be used to visualize, analyze, and mitigate the issues associated with the financial sustainability of the chain. We propose a software platform that employs key enabling technologies, including AI, blockchain, knowledge graph, and others, opportunely coordinated to address the financial sustainability problem affecting single stakeholders and the entire supply chain. This platform allows for the involvement of external entities that can help stakeholders or the whole supply chain to solve financial sustainability problems through economic interventions. Moreover, introducing these entities enables stakeholders less well-positioned in the market to access financial services offered by credit institutions, utilising the supply chain's internal information as evidence of its reliability. To validate the proposed idea, a case study will be presented analyzing the financial instrument of securitization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ITADATA2024: The 3rd Italian Conference on Big Data and Data Science</p></details> |

This study aims to highlight the impact of breast region segmentation (BRS) on deep learning-based breast lesion segmentation (BLS) in breast DCE-MRI. Methods Using the Stavanger Dataset containing primarily 59 DCE-MRI scans and UNet++ as deep learning models, four different process were conducted to compare effect of BRS on BLS. These four approaches included the whole volume without BRS and with BRS, BRS with the selected lesion slices and lastly optimal volume with BRS. Preprocessing methods like augmentation and oversampling were used to enhance the small dataset, data shape uniformity and improve model performance. Optimal volume size were investigated by a precise process to ensure that all lesions existed in slices. To evaluate the model, a hybrid loss function including dice, focal and cross entropy along with 5-fold cross validation method were used and lastly a test dataset which was randomly split used to evaluate the model performance on unseen data for each of four mentioned approaches. Results Results demonstrate that using BRS considerably improved model performance and validation. Significant improvement in last approach -- optimal volume with BRS -- compared to the approach without BRS counting around 50 percent demonstrating how effective BRS has been in BLS. Moreover, huge improvement in energy consumption, decreasing up to 450 percent, introduces a green solution toward a more environmentally sustainable approach for future work on large dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which LCA informs the design of computing devices remains unclear. To understand how this information is collected and applied, we interviewed 17 industry professionals with experience in LCA or electronics design, systematically coded the interviews, and investigated common themes. These themes highlight the challenge of LCA data collection and reveal distributed decision-making processes where responsibility for sustainable design choices, and their associated costs, is often ambiguous. Our analysis identifies opportunities for HCI technologies to support LCA computation and its integration into the design process to facilitate sustainability-oriented decision-making. While this work provides a nuanced discussion about sustainable design in the information and communication technologies (ICT) hardware industry, we hope our insights will also be valuable to other sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Microclimate Modeling: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. Using high-frequency data collected at 15-minute intervals from a greenhouse in Volos, Greece, we demonstrate that RNNs achieve exceptional accuracy in winter conditions ($R^2 = 0.985$) but show limitations during summer cooling system operation. Though STGNNs currently show lower performance (winter $R^2 = 0.947$), their architecture offers greater potential for integrating additional variables such as PV generation and crop growth indicators.</p></details> |  |

However, there are significant deficiencies in its efficiency for handling multiattribute analysis and its ability to expand model knowledge, making it difficult to adapt to the ever-changing network environment and complex identification requirements. To address this issue, we proposed the SNAKE (Sustainable Network Analysis with Knowledge Exploration) system, which adopts a multi-gated mixture of experts architecture to construct a multi-functional traffic classification model. The system analyzes traffic attributes at different levels through multiple expert sub-models, providing predictions for these attributes via gating and a final Tower network. Additionally, through an intelligent gating configuration, the system enables extremely fast model integration and evolution across various knowledge expansion scenarios. Its excellent compatibility allows it to continuously evolve into a multi-functional largescale model in the field of traffic analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that the SNAKE system exhibits remarkable scalability when faced with incremental challenges in diverse traffic classification tasks. Currently, we have integrated multiple models into the system, enabling it to classify a wide range of attributes, such as encapsulation usage, application types and numerous malicious behaviors. We believe that SNAKE can pioneeringly create a sustainable and multifunctional large-scale model in the field of network traffic analysis after continuous expansion.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sustainability Analysis Patterns for Process Mining and Process Modelling Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13584v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Business Process Management (BPM) has the potential to help companies manage and reduce their activities' negative social and environmental impacts. However, so far, only limited capabilities for analysing the sustainability impacts of processes have been integrated into established BPM methods and tools. One of the main challenges of existing Sustainable BPM approaches is the lack of a sound conception of sustainability impacts. This paper describes a set of sustainability analysis patterns that integrate BPM concepts with concepts from existing sustainability analysis methods to address this challenge. The patterns provide a framework to evaluate and develop process modelling and process mining approaches for discovering, analysing and improving the sustainability impacts of processes. It is shown how the patterns can be used to evaluate existing process modelling and process mining approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLEX: A Framework for Learning Robot-Agnostic Force-based Skills Involving Sustained Contact Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13418v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to manipulate objects efficiently, particularly those involving sustained contact (e.g., pushing, sliding) and articulated parts (e.g., drawers, doors), presents significant challenges. Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics -- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting.

While prior work has assessed the success of online collaborations, most approaches are time-agnostic, evaluating success without considering its longevity. Research on the factors that ensure the long-term preservation of high-quality standards in online collaboration is scarce. In this study, we address this gap. We propose a novel metric, `Sustainable Success,' which measures the ability of collaborative efforts to maintain their quality over time. Using Wikipedia as a case study, we introduce the SustainPedia dataset, which compiles data from over 40K Wikipedia articles, including each article's sustainable success label and more than 300 explanatory features such as edit history, user experience, and team composition. Using this dataset, we develop machine learning models to predict the sustainable success of Wikipedia articles. Our best-performing model achieves a high AU-ROC score of 0.88 on average. Our analysis reveals important insights. For example, we find that the longer an article takes to be recognized as high-quality, the more likely it is to maintain that status over time (i.e., be sustainable). Additionally, user experience emerged as the most critical predictor of sustainability. Our analysis provides insights into broader collective actions beyond Wikipedia (e.g., online activism, crowdsourced open-source software), where the same social dynamics that drive success on Wikipedia might play a role. We make all data and code used for this study publicly available for further research.</p></details> |  |

Moving beyond the already well-researched economic and technical aspects, our approach to SusDevOps emphasizes the importance of minimizing environmental impacts, fostering social inclusion, and supporting individual well-being in software engineering practices. We highlight some key challenges in incorporating these dimensions, such as reducing ecological footprints, promoting workforce inclusion, and addressing the individual well-being of developers. We plan to adopt a structured approach incorporating systematic literature reviews, surveys, and interviews to deepen our understanding, identify gaps, and evolve actionable, sustainable practices within the DevOps community. Collectively, these initiatives can contribute to a more sustainable software engineering ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Sustainability in 6G and beyond: Challenges and Opportunities of Open RAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08353v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition to 6G is expected to bring significant advancements, including much higher data rates, enhanced reliability and ultra-low latency compared to previous generations. Although 6G is anticipated to be 100 times more energy efficient, this increased efficiency does not necessarily mean reduced energy consumption or enhanced sustainability. Network sustainability encompasses a broader scope, integrating business viability, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. This paper explores the sustainability requirements for 6G and proposes Open RAN as a key architectural solution. By enabling network diversification, fostering open and continuous innovation, and integrating AI/ML, Open RAN can promote sustainability in 6G. The paper identifies high energy consumption and e-waste generation as critical sustainability challenges and discusses how Open RAN can address these issues through softwarisation, edge computing, and AI integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at IEEE Communications Standards Magazine on 11 March 2025</p></details> |

It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Co-Simulation Variants for Emissions and Cost Reduction of Sustainable District Heating Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08225v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical heating of residential areas is very energy-intensive, so alternatives are needed, including renewable energies and advanced heating technologies. Thus, the present paper introduces a new methodology for comprehensive variant analysis for future district heating planning, aiming at optimizing emissions and costs. For this, an extensive Modelica-based modeling study comprising models of heating center, heat grid pipelines and heating interface units to buildings are coupled in co-simulations. These enable a comparative analysis of the economic feasibility and sustainability for various technologies and energy carriers to be carried out. The new modular and highly parameterizable building model serves for validation of the introduced heat grid model. The results show that bio-methane as an energy source reduces carbon equivalent emissions by nearly 70% compared to conventional natural gas heating, and the use of hydrogen as an energy source reduces carbon equivalent emissions by 77% when equipped with a heat pump. In addition, the use of ground source heat pumps has a high economic viability when economic benefits are taken into account. The study findings highlight the importance of strategic planning and flexible design in the early stages of district development in order to achieve improved energy efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |

It raises the crucial question about how to sustain human agency in AI-mediated communication. We investigated this question in the context of machine translation (MT) assisted conversations. Our participants included 45 dyads. Each dyad consisted of one new immigrant in the United States, who leveraged MT for English information seeking as a non-native speaker, and one local native speaker, who acted as the information provider. Non-native speakers could influence the English production of their message in one of three ways: labeling the quality of MT outputs, regular post-editing without additional hints, or augmented post-editing with LLM-generated hints. Our data revealed a greater exercise of non-native speakers' agency under the two post-editing conditions. This benefit, however, came at a significant cost to the dyadic-level communication performance. We derived insights for MT and other generative AI design from our findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Visions: Unsupervised Machine Learning Insights on Global Development Goals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12427v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations outlines 17 goals for countries of the world to address global challenges in their development. However, the progress of countries towards these goal has been slower than expected and, consequently, there is a need to investigate the reasons behind this fact. In this study, we have used a novel data-driven methodology to analyze time-series data for over 20 years (2000-2022) from 107 countries using unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. Our analysis reveals strong positive and negative correlations between certain SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Our findings show that progress toward the SDGs is heavily influenced by geographical, cultural and socioeconomic factors, with no country on track to achieve all the goals by 2030. This highlights the need for a region-specific, systemic approach to sustainable development that acknowledges the complex interdependencies between the goals and the variable capacities of countries to reach them. For this our machine learning based approach provides a robust framework for developing efficient and data-informed strategies to promote cooperative and targeted initiatives for sustainable progress.</p></details> |  |

With digital fabrication technology, this study explores the transition from traditional, single function building facades to multifunctional, integrated building systems. It introduces a photobioreactor (PBR) fa\c{c}ade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations while addressing the challenge of large-scale prefabricated components transportation. This research introduces a novel approach by designing the fa\c{c}ade system as modular, user-friendly and transportation-friendly bricks, enabling the creation of a user-customized and self-assembled photobioreactor (PBR) system. The single module in the system is proposed to be "neutralization bricks", which embedded with algae and equipped with an air circulation system, facilitating the photobioreactor (PBR)'s functionality. A connection system between modules allows for easy assembly by users, while a limited variety of brick styles ensures modularity in manufacturing without sacrificing customization and diversity. The system is also equipped with an advanced microalgae status detection algorithm, which allows users to monitor the condition of the microalgae using monocular camera. This functionality ensures timely alerts and notifications for users to replace the algae, thereby optimizing the operational efficiency and sustainability of the algae cultivation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 22 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, its sustainability remains underexplored, as energy consumption and carbon emissions vary across different system configurations. Understanding the environmental impact of DFL is crucial for optimizing its design and deployment. This work aims to develop a comprehensive and operational framework for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. To address it, this work provides a systematic method for quantifying energy consumption and carbon emissions, offering insights into improving the sustainability of DFL. This work proposes GreenDFL, a fully implementable framework that has been integrated into a real-world DFL platform. GreenDFL systematically analyzes the impact of various factors, including hardware accelerators, model architecture, communication medium, data distribution, network topology, and federation size, on the sustainability of DFL systems. Besides, a sustainability-aware aggregation algorithm (GreenDFL-SA) and a node selection algorithm (GreenDFL-SN) are developed to optimize energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in DFL training. Empirical experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions at different phases of the DFL lifecycle. The proposed GreenDFL provides a comprehensive and practical approach for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. Furthermore, it offers best practices for improving environmental efficiency in DFL, making sustainability considerations more actionable in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Ecomap, a sustainability-driven framework that dynamically adjusts the maximum power threshold of edge devices based on real-time carbon intensity. Ecomap incorporates the innovative use of mixed-quality models, allowing it to dynamically replace computationally heavy DNNs with lighter alternatives when latency constraints are violated, ensuring service responsiveness with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, it employs a transformer-based estimator to guide efficient workload mappings. Experimental results using NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier demonstrate that Ecomap reduces carbon emissions by an average of 30% and achieves a 25% lower carbon delay product (CDP) compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable or better latency and power efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), FairSense-AI uncovers subtle forms of prejudice or stereotyping that can appear in content, providing users with bias scores, explanatory highlights, and automated recommendations for fairness enhancements. In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk assessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured identification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for energy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision computation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint.

The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISMIR 2024</p></details> |

We analyze ASR biases w.r.t. gender, accent, and age group, as well as their effect on downstream tasks. In addition, we examine the environmental impact of ASR systems, scrutinizing the use of large acoustic models on carbon emission and energy consumption. We also provide insights into our empirical analyses, offering a valuable contribution to the claims surrounding bias and sustainability in ASR systems.</p></details> | Interspeech 2024 |
| **[Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14160v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing attention and investment in recent AI approaches such as large language models, the narrative that the larger the AI system the more valuable, powerful and interesting it is is increasingly seen as common sense. But what is this assumption based on, and how are we measuring value, power, and performance? And what are the collateral consequences of this race to ever-increasing scale? Here, we scrutinize the current scaling trends and trade-offs across multiple axes and refute two common assumptions underlying the 'bigger-is-better' AI paradigm: 1) that performance improvements are driven by increased scale, and 2) that all interesting problems addressed by AI require large-scale models. Rather, we argue that this approach is not only fragile scientifically, but comes with undesirable consequences. First, it is not sustainable, as, despite efficiency improvements, its compute demands increase faster than model performance, leading to unreasonable economic requirements and a disproportionate environmental footprint. Second, it implies focusing on certain problems at the expense of others, leaving aside important applications, e.g. health, education, or the climate. Finally, it exacerbates a concentration of power, which centralizes decision-making in the hands of a few actors while threatening to disempower others in the context of shaping both AI research and its applications throughout society.</p></details> |  |

In a constrained world, achieving a balanced design across those dimensions has become challenging. However a number of strategies have emerged to tackle specific aspects such as preserving resources, improving the circularity in product lifecycles and ensuring global fairness. This paper explores how to capture constitutive elements of those strategies using a modelling approach based on a reference sustainability meta-model and pattern template. After proposing an extension to the meta-modelling to enable the structuring of a pattern catalogue, we highlight how it can be populated on two case studies respectively covering fairness and circularity.</p></details> |  |

While systematic reviews address sustainability in the context of Smart Cities (a category of SoS), a systematic study synthesizing the existing knowledge on environmental sustainability applied to SoS in general does not exist. Although literature includes other types of sustainability, such as financial and social, this study focuses on environmental sustainability, analyzing how SoS contribute to sustainable practices such as carbon emission reduction, energy efficiency, and biodiversity conservation. We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study to identify the application domains of SoS in sustainability, the challenges faced, and research opportunities. We planned and executed a research protocol including an automated search over four scientific databases. Of 926 studies retrieved, we selected, analyzed, and reported the results of 39 relevant studies. Our findings reveal that most studies focus on Smart Cities and Smart Grids, while applications such as sustainable agriculture and wildfire prevention are less explored. We identified challenges such as system interoperability, scalability, and data governance. Finally, we propose future research directions for SoS and environmental sustainability.</p></details> |  |

However, the nascent discourse that is emerging on sustainable artificial intelligence (AI) has predominantly focused on the environmental sustainability of AI, often neglecting the economic and social aspects. Achieving truly sustainable AI necessitates addressing the tension between its climate awareness and its social sustainability, which hinges on equitable access to AI development resources. The concept of resource awareness advocates for broader access to the infrastructure required to develop AI, fostering equity in AI innovation. Yet, this push for improving accessibility often overlooks the environmental costs of expanding such resource usage. In this position paper, we argue that reconciling climate and resource awareness is essential to realizing the full potential of sustainable AI. We use the framework of base-superstructure to analyze how the material conditions are influencing the current AI discourse. We also introduce the Climate and Resource Aware Machine Learning (CARAML) framework to address this conflict and propose actionable recommendations spanning individual, community, industry, government, and global levels to achieve sustainable AI.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

These so-called web agents have the ability to interact autonomously with the internet. This allows them to become powerful daily assistants handling time-consuming, repetitive tasks while supporting users in their daily activities. While web agent research is thriving, the sustainability aspect of this research direction remains largely unexplored. We provide an initial exploration of the energy and CO2 cost associated with web agents. Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely impact the associated expended energy. We highlight lacking transparency regarding the disclosure of model parameters and processes used for some web agents as a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. As such, our work advocates a change in thinking when evaluating web agents, warranting dedicated metrics for energy consumption and sustainability.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a teleology-driven affective computing framework that unifies major emotion theories (basic emotion, appraisal, and constructivist approaches) under the premise that affect is an adaptive, goal-directed process that facilitates survival and development. Our framework emphasizes aligning agent responses with both personal/individual and group/collective well-being over extended timescales. We advocate for creating a "dataverse" of personal affective events, capturing the interplay between beliefs, goals, actions, and outcomes through real-world experience sampling and immersive virtual reality. By leveraging causal modeling, this "dataverse" enables AI systems to infer individuals' unique affective concerns and provide tailored interventions for sustained well-being. Additionally, we introduce a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm to train agents in simulated environments, allowing them to adapt to evolving affective concerns and balance hierarchical goals - from immediate emotional needs to long-term self-actualization. This framework shifts the focus from statistical correlations to causal reasoning, enhancing agents' ability to predict and respond proactively to emotional challenges, and offers a foundation for developing personalized, ethically aligned affective systems that promote meaningful human-AI interactions and societal well-being.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

However, the extensive computational resources required for training these models have significant environmental implications, including high carbon emissions, energy consumption, and water usage. This research presents a novel approach to LLM pruning, focusing on the systematic evaluation of individual weight importance throughout the training process. By monitoring parameter evolution over time, we propose a method that effectively reduces model size without compromising performance. Extensive experiments with both a scaled-down LLM and a large multimodal model reveal that moderate pruning enhances efficiency and reduces loss, while excessive pruning drastically deteriorates model performance. These findings highlight the critical need for optimized AI models to ensure sustainable development, balancing technological advancement with environmental responsibility.</p></details> |  |

Implementing such measures, including the development of resilient infrastructure and retrofitting existing systems, demands substantial financial investment. Unfortunately, due to the unprofitability stemming from the long-term returns, uncertainty, and complexity of infrastructure adaptation projects and the short-term profit-seeking objectives of private capital, a massive financial gap remains. This study suggests incentivizing private capital to bridge financial gaps through integrated carbon markets. Specifically, the framework combines carbon taxes and carbon markets to involve infrastructure and individuals in the climate mitigation phase, using the funds collected for climate adaptation. Moreover, it integrates lifestyle reformation, environmental mitigation, and infrastructure adaptation to establish harmonized standards and provide circular positive feedback to sustain the markets.

| **[The Esethu Framework: Reimagining Sustainable Dataset Governance and Curation for Low-Resource Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15916v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Esethu Framework, a sustainable data curation framework specifically designed to empower local communities and ensure equitable benefit-sharing from their linguistic resources. This framework is supported by the Esethu license, a novel community-centric data license. As a proof of concept, we introduce the Vuk'uzenzele isiXhosa Speech Dataset (ViXSD), an open-source corpus developed under the Esethu Framework and License. The dataset, containing read speech from native isiXhosa speakers enriched with demographic and linguistic metadata, demonstrates how community-driven licensing and curation principles can bridge resource gaps in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages while safeguarding the interests of data creators. We describe the framework guiding dataset development, outline the Esethu license provisions, present the methodology for ViXSD, and present ASR experiments validating ViXSD's usability in building and refining voice-driven applications for isiXhosa.</p></details> |  |
| **[PCB Renewal: Iterative Reuse of PCB Substrates for Sustainable Electronic Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13255v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PCB (printed circuit board) substrates are often single-use, leading to material waste in electronics making. We introduce PCB Renewal, a novel technique that "erases" and "reconfigures" PCB traces by selectively depositing conductive epoxy onto outdated areas, transforming isolated paths into conductive planes that support new traces. We present the PCB Renewal workflow, evaluate its electrical performance and mechanical durability, and model its sustainability impact, including material usage, cost, energy consumption, and time savings. We develop a software plug-in that guides epoxy deposition, generates updated PCB profiles, and calculates resource usage. To demonstrate PCB Renewal's effectiveness and versatility, we repurpose a single PCB across four design iterations spanning three projects: a camera roller, a WiFi radio, and an ESPboy game console. We also show how an outsourced double-layer PCB can be reconfigured, transforming it from an LED watch to an interactive cat toy. The paper concludes with limitations and future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Make Making Sustainable: Exploring Sustainability Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities in Making Activities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13254v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent democratization of personal fabrication has significantly advanced the maker movement and reshaped applied research in HCI and beyond. However, this growth has also raised increasing sustainability concerns, as material waste is an inevitable byproduct of making and rapid prototyping. In this work, we examine the sustainability landscape within the modern maker community, focusing on grassroots makerspaces and maker-oriented research labs through in-depth interviews with diverse stakeholders involved in making and managing making-related activities. Our findings highlight four key themes: the various types of "waste" generated through the making process, the strategies (or lack thereof) for managing this waste, the motivations driving (un)sustainable practices, and the challenges faced. We synthesize these insights into design considerations and takeaways for technical HCI researchers and the broader community, focusing on future tools, infrastructures, and educational approaches to foster sustainable making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Responsible and Fair Data Science: Resource Allocation for Inclusive and Sustainable Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11459v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This project addresses the challenges of responsible and fair resource allocation in data science (DS), focusing on DS queries evaluation. Current DS practices often overlook the broader socio-economic, environmental, and ethical implications, including data sovereignty, fairness, and inclusivity. By integrating a decolonial perspective, the project aims to establish innovative fairness metrics that respect cultural and contextual diversity, optimise computational and energy efficiency, and ensure equitable participation of underrepresented communities. The research includes developing algorithms to align resource allocation with fairness constraints, incorporating ethical and sustainability considerations, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to bridge technical advancements and societal impact gaps. This work aims to reshape into an equitable, transparent, and community-empowering practice challenging the technological power developed by the Big Tech.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Large Language Models as Data Sources for Policy Deliberation on Climate Change and Sustainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05708v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We pose the research question, "Can LLMs provide credible evaluation scores, suitable for constructing starter MCDM models that support commencing deliberation regarding climate and sustainability policies?" In this exploratory study we i. Identify a number of interesting policy alternatives that are actively considered by local governments in the United States (and indeed around the world). ii. Identify a number of quality-of-life indicators as apt evaluation criteria for these policies. iii. Use GPT-4 to obtain evaluation scores for the policies on multiple criteria. iv. Use the TOPSIS MCDM method to rank the policies based on the obtained evaluation scores. v. Evaluate the quality and validity of the resulting table ensemble of scores by comparing the TOPSIS-based policy rankings with those obtained by an informed assessment exercise. We find that GPT-4 is in rough agreement with the policy rankings of our informed assessment exercise. Hence, we conclude (always provisionally and assuming a modest level of vetting) that GPT-4 can be used as a credible input, even starting point, for subsequent deliberation processes on climate and sustainability policies.</p></details> | 32 pages. 4 figures |
| **[Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted at 2nd Workshop on 'Public Interest AI' co-located with 47th German Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Wuerzburg 23rd September 2024</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Sustainability and Trustworthiness of Federated Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20435v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence is widely used in various sectors and significantly impacts decision-making processes. Novel AI paradigms, such as Federated Learning (FL), focus on training AI models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. In such a context, the European Commission's AI-HLEG group has highlighted the importance of sustainable AI for trustworthy AI. While existing literature offers several solutions for assessing the trustworthiness of FL models, a significant gap exists in considering sustainability associated with FL. Thus, this work introduces the sustainability pillar to the trustworthy FL taxonomy, making this work the first to address all AI-HLEG requirements. The sustainability pillar assesses the FL system's environmental impact, incorporating notions and metrics for hardware efficiency, federation complexity, and energy grid carbon intensity. An algorithm is developed to evaluate the trustworthiness of FL models, incorporating sustainability considerations. Extensive evaluations with the FederatedScope framework and various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p></details> |  |
